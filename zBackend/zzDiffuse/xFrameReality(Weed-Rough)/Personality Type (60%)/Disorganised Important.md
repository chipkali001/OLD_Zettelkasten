ISFJ mothers afraid of children wont talk to them later 

Fe feel like have more mirror neurons


Fe expressive with emotions and really expressive face. 
Ne is to expressive but bubliness attached to it (you may look at them and think they have infinite energy)
Fi maybe not express thing others as it may not deem it important to share. Since **Fi is introverted**


Informative types cryptic, subtext important.
Reason why women stereotype true for only 50% they don't say what they want to say directly, there is hidden meaning, puzzle peace, they expect you to figure it out


Ne-Si most common
Si first function most common
artisians (Se-Ni) rarer than guardian 
NJs rarer than NP (ENFP most common)
Te-Fi more common than Ti-Fe.
Te-Fi more understandable to general public as people consider logic-external & feelings-internal.
Poetry conveys that.
Fi authenicity. Fe harmony.
Fi may express less.
Fi may keep emotions to themselves as they don't feel words don't express depth so rsort to art
(My Ti consider feelings to lie, only Ni matters, what they are extracting, what meaning it holds to them)
Ni is hard to understand for those who don't have it. 
Ni don't feel misunderstood they are misunderstood. (Ni care about relatity below reality and people maynot be interested in that)
(Maybe that's why u wanted human with whom can talk but they don't want to)


**FJs** play favourite, kmow what they like, what they really really like.
May not tell it to everyone. 

Te humor - make fun of incompetence. 
You are defective! 
Ti (god) - my framework is supreme and they are dumb for not seeing.

### Ni-Se/Fi-Te = most individualist
Same reality, all same fact, while upbring etc matters, but in end everyone should be able to look at all in same way.
They don't think they can be boiled down into Si, To understanding 
Singular thing which everyone should be able to see it.
I can see something so clearly which others don't.
They see things as they are. 
Example of this common INTJ Arrogance my bro.
He should have kicked that boy in class and dragged him (jaamin pr khdedr kaar teachers kee paas Lee jayte, i would have thould you we amaazing, being drunk in arrogance not helping anything. 
*I was too disappointed in him, angry+sad and couldn't speak anything cause I felt sorry for lots of people going through same.*
**fi can have strong sense sense of duty responsibility but selfishness to it.**

### **Ne-Si/Fe-Ti** = less individualisc
Ne, Fe consideres and accept people difference even if they contradict each other & they try to boil it to Si, To for universal understanding that encomposses and embraces all 
Fe sees emotional need
Ne all mutliple concepts someone can have

To be friends with people who lack Ne Fe, you have to share them your Ni, Te facts and logic, basically whole life story to connect


Many sensors won't see point in mbti so you will have to give them reason that connects to sensory world first.

Se - reacting acting superfastly like labron James. Looking at everyone observing taking in and acting reacting.
Best at chaotic situation
Than sitting on table and planning or oeganising

Teaching mom mbti.
There was higher enagagment bond formation when discussed something common.
Like my behaviours and that to which function.
Me referencing her dialogues.
So when you talk and want to explain before that collect information about common ground.
Maybe GOT characters.
Words of common friend.

Fe heros and Fe in cognitive make people emotionally exploitative most. 


Fe child ESTP ENTP plays with emotion

Te maybe hawk view but blurry. This model here that model there and everything just an mumbo jumbo mix of stuff.
Ti wherars can help pinpoint the problem and principle

Inferior Se - can't stop bonging or indulging in fight (like I had urge supressed), thrill 

Te most masculine 
Se most manly 
Masculine I used as force not male female but 
manly and womanly is male female

I feel Ne are most considerate people.
Fe more motherly cuddly 


Misunderstanding 
Te look at Fe - sharing emotions = sharing identity
Why did you emotionally explode your reputation got wrecked.

Fe look at Te - sharing ideas or way of doing things = sharing idenity.
Te - uh it was silly dumb idea
Fe - don't call yourself dumb. I just want you to know you're not dumb


ost trustworthy:

-   ISTJs (They just are. They don't have Fe as to bullshit, and they don't get involved in pointless games, with them it's if they say something, that's because that's exactly the way it is).
    
-   INTPs (Not enough interest in the real world or other people as to have an interest in lying. This is where their solipsism comes in handy in a good way.)
    
-   ISFPs (I've just found that they tend not to be too good at keeping a lid on things which bother them, and so have a distinct lack of the ability to be fake. You just kinda know how they feel about you and how they feel about stuff in general if you're remotely observant, essentially.)
    

Least trustworthy:

-   ENFJs. So fake their fake self is their true self. They don't have an honest bone in their body and they often don't even know the truth privately themselves. The truth is whatever is convenient to state in the Fe sense. Completely obvious that they're the conflict relation to ISTJs.
    
-   ENTJs (I'd think this one is obvious.)
    
-   ESFJs. (I'd put them with ENFJs in terms of being willing to be fake, but they're not smart enough to do it covertly. They're fake and if you're not braindead, you can tell that they're fake.)
    
-   ENTPs/ESTPs (No Fi. Really zero moral principles. ENTPs especially sometimes consciously train their manipulative abilities. They aren't as good at it as they think they are, you can see right through it, but even seeing through it doesn't exactly instill confidence regarding their general character).
    
-   INFJs. (I love them, but yeah. You don't really know where you're standing with them sometimes. Often have their own private narratives in their head that you're the unwitting participant of and which they judge you based on, which you don't even know is happening. It can feel as if everything's great for 5 years and then you get handed the Eviction Notice, AKA the DoorSlamTM happens. Would save more trouble to both themselves and other people if they'd just fucking Talk About The Things Bothering Them. Also how they see things. Because this can be very, very, _very_ off, and they tend to lack the reality check when they start "Ni-Ti looping".) Not as much lying as concealing, but has a similar effect.
    
-   INTJs. (We deserve an honorable mention. We can be shady, Machiavellian fuckers, not so much in lying in terms of emotion, but in terms of sometimes pointing out of not pointing out Te-type things in order to produce a certain effect in terms of other people's behavior. It's like the Non-Icky form of manipulation, while lying about emotions would be the Icky form, which is why ENFJs are The Devil

From my own experiences, most trusting is ENFP. Their Ne keeps finding reasons after reasons while others would have already judged the situation based on likelihood. And they are prone to accept bad outcomes and classify them as part of natural process (which I think it’s their defense mechanism to keep their optimism, an internal part of their health).

But they won’t budge against certain things that go against their values (ethics). And they will be less trusting if they are hurt (self-preservation).

ISFJ pretty trusting as well, but not in an innocent/pure/naive/childlike way like an ENFP would, but more like it’s their responsibility to nourish the person they feel duty to entrust. ISFJ can catch themselves in a toxic situation because of their resilience. Though I find ISFJ is more selective with who they trust, while ENFP tend to accept a wider array of people and situations.



Disclaimer: I don’t mean to offend anyone and this is just based on my interpretations of the MBTI.

So let’s make a list of the least fake MBTI types:

I would say the least likely types to be fake are INTP’s and ISTP’s. They’re both utilitarian types who both live in their heads. They would prefer to be genuine and dismiss the people who dislike them as “stupid” or just not care.

Second least would be INTJ’s and ISTJ’s. These two would put on an amount of social image, but for the most part, you’d know what you’re getting.

Third come ENTP’s and ESTP’s. They don’t hide anything, and everything’s out in the open in all its competitive glory.

Fourth, INFJ’s and ISFJ’s. INFJ’s put on the image of kindness and benevolence to disguise their masterminding and the ISFJ’s would never ever let you know you hurt them.

Fifth, ENTJ’s and ESTJ’s. They’re all about master plans, so they’ll keep all their thought about you under wraps, all for the greater good.

Sixth, ENFP’s. They try their best to get people to like them, but they are charismatic enough to not want to change themselves too much.

Seventh, ESFP’s. They’re basically ENFP’s with an extra energy boost. They’re more themselves than others, but unfortunately do need a good amount of social approval.

Eighth come INFP and ISFP’s. They’re very private people, and so they keep all their thoughts festering inside, all because they don’t want to hurt you or to avoid conflict.

Ninth, ESFJ’s and ENFJ’s. These people are the masters of social convention. They know what people like and don’t like, and are not afraid to act that way. They are the most likely to succeed as leaders in social situations, but this does mean a lot of faking.

So the winner of the most fake MBTI personality is ESFJ and ENFJ

Fe - atompshere, emotions 
Fi - likes/dislikes

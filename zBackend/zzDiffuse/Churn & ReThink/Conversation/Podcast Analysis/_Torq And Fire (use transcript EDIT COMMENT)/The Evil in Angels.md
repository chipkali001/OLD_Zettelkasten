Me and Komal got vaccinated
It was a crazy experience. (Torq)
It was insane (komal)
*Torq narrates  in tone of when you narrate an funny/interesting progression/story*
In beginning everyone was thinking it will be fun
we are expecting
It has never been in your life expecting to fall sick
that in 12 hours you are going sick
and until and unless you do fall sick
You donot realize it is not actually fun time.
==that happens
that happens==



1. We got Vaccinated

hello everyone this is ashish i'm having with me miss komal thai and today we are going to have 32nd episode

of talk and fire podcast yes ashish welcome thank you and welcome everyone we are

going to have a great time today komal and me just got vaccinated as updated in the last one yeah

and it was a crazy experience yeah it was like insane in beginning everyone

was thinking that it will be fun it will be well we are expecting it is it has never been ever in your life that you

are expecting to fall sick that you know that in 12 hours you are going to fall sick

yeah and until unless you do fall sick you do not actually realize that it is

not a fun time at all that happens that happens only in the case of deadly diseases when you

have the ultimate stage of cancer and you know that you're gonna die all right that kind of certainty yeah

i'm not saying that normal cough and cold or fever yeah yeah that is unexpected and also

generally fevers do last at least for me it lasts for three days or so what about you how long

does fevers last i think four days more than i think uh one extra day than you three days will

be peak and i didn't get fever i didn't get the that uh high fever maybe it was in my

head that my head it was yeah it was different my eyes they were my tears were

completely rolling out of my eyes and as if my head it will burst out i was cold i was feeling cold but

the temperature it was not that much maybe it was inside my head yeah it is different for different

people so me and komal actually got side by side vaccinated yeah they were simultaneously yeah there

were two two seats in the same place two nurses over there and we got almost

at the same time at particular instances there were injection in both of our arms like that exactly so basically

the same thing but how it acted was completely different to both of us right so for me it was a little bit of

body ache and a little bit of fever heavy fever late night and the worst thing that i

did is that i took three cups of coffee until then i was perfectly fine and then because of this coffee i was not able to

sleep at night and that's where the trouble happened because if i was able to sleep then it would have been

wearing off over yeah you took medicine also instead of that you got hit by fever right yeah yeah

yeah yeah the weird thing about this thing is that uh suppose you are getting vaccinated

and from that moment only you will start realizing uh did anything happen am i feeling

anything is that kind of tickling feeling and those kind of imaginary imaginary world you start diving into

right yeah so you just start thinking that whether i'll be hit by this or that oh i felt something so

sometimes it's not the same but you must be feeling that in your head remember psychological also i just got

vaccinated and i told ashish that ashish my arm is feeling heavy he

started laughing just after just stepping out of the room he started laughing that

it's all chimera it's all in your head so he just bursted into laughter and was

like no i'm feeling it then also i felt for the moment i felt okay is right maybe it's in my head yeah but

after some time maybe when i came back to my room i again started saying same thing to ashish that um

i'm feeling that as my as with my arm it's going to i actually laughed because the moment

you said that i'm feeling my arm heavy then my brain imagined it like you are this heavy like

falling foreign someone injected liters and liters or something in your arm and now it is heavy i thought

you were moking at me that i am something like as if it's in my head and

i'm imagining thanks out of after matter of fact right after after that in two to three hours within that

also you started saying that i'm feeling a little bit headache i'm feeling a little bit of fever and i said

that no it's in your head and i was like nothing can happen to me yeah six hours later i found out that no

no no he was completely showing off in front of our friends who also got vaccinated

yeah right all of us are getting vaccinated so he was showing off nothing is happening to me look at komal

she's already sick and like that and then you got hit by this abrupt fever right yeah it was it was crazy but it is that

is the another weird thing about this vaccine or this kind of fever is that it will wear off in one day

maybe it happened to you because you you made fun of me yeah of course cursed by the vaccine waxing god's curse

oh my god we are watching way too much naruto these days

the second run we are having i think it is kind of third for me but we all skipped some episodes right

but this time we thought that we are not going to skip any episode but you did skip yeah

but that is something like bound to happen the episodes which i've watched way too many times

that i have to skip but that is what we are doing and let us talk about this komal's ad just

2. Komalâ€™s recent Ad

came out so guys if you see komal on televisions and advertisement of parley cookie then don't get surprised

you are going to see her and future maybe more i don't know how to take compliments i start getting weird when

someone just gives me those kind of compliments you got open mic compliment while they were shooting how did it feel at that

time how did you take it then what that ma'am know i think what was her name akansha

who who was the i think director or producer producer yeah yeah thomas dance is the best yeah she

i still remember she was saying like she was damn funny she was calling one person who was just

putting nails into the tent because it was camping site and we were supposed to shoot over there so

he was just putting nails in the cam that tent then what happened like they made a cigarette

she was really funny so i came at the end only and she was again making a lot of jokes

with backup and all also right yes and she has a mic so people who do not understand the situation

it is a huge huge set you can't really imagine it is humongous you will think that unit right yeah some

movie is getting shot or something but the cameras are huge okay probably 8k cameras there's a person who's

so anil sir what is his role actually over there cinematography cinematographer so he

will be actually just directing okay this is how the camera is handling the camera and when it comes to the head

yeah when it and she and he has made big movies we have seen his name in a lot of ranbir kapoor which movie was there but

all many movies did we see in uh ladies versus vicky vicky sorry ladies versus vicky

bear something like that i was just asking whether we saw his name in that movies

yeah yeah yeah we saw that yeah in that movie also so he shot many movies not that much active on social media maybe

that's why i'm not knowing it i just visited his profile and that's how i knew that okay he's done such

films yeah he's an old guy and yeah definitely has been in this professional too

you took a selfie with him right you still have it yeah all right great you never posted it though

on insta i just put it in my story highlight all right great so i was just explaining

the scenario so it is vegatar beach most people who have gone to goa the north

park yeah beach you have most likely visited if you have gone there if not then definitely supposed to be there

and the sunburn and all happens very nearby so on that only on hilltop area it

happens usually all right no i've actually been in a sunburn before okay so sanban was the opposite side they

have a fixed kind of field kind of place very nearby walking distance so there's a director and there's a this

big camera multiple shots big lights they have like curtains as

what do we call it diffusers as diffusers that we are having small ones over here right they're having as big as this room and

then the lighting and all and so the producer always has a mic

and then she cracks jokes every now and then but it is necessary right yeah she asked me to come and say pack

up because i had a very short voice i also have also took the opportunity

when she asked that who wants to say back up yeah i want to say because without mike

without mike only i can manage that all right great so that was a great experience

maybe you can go to komal's instagram to check it out yeah and rest i had an idea

3. What if Lockdown never happened

which i wanted to bring all of a sudden in the podcast so what would have happened i'm not

saying lockdown was correct or if it was wrong i just want to play with my imagination

and what would have happened if lockdown never actually took place no

country they all decided that now we are just going to keep on running so are you saying that kovit happened

and yeah nobody yes nobody went for lockdown yes are you telling that yeah okay

then things would have gone much worse more people died for sure yeah for sure

there's no doubt in it more people would have died and the economy

i think i don't when people talk about such things and there's lot of you know buzz about this

question everywhere like whether lockdown is just justified or not

so in my opinion it's completely justified you know i'm not talking about whether it is justified it

is right or wrong i'm just saying that what if the leaders of this world looked at the economy versus the death

rate and all that and they just all decided that we are not going to go for lockdown then you may we would be living

in a different world right now don't you think yeah it could have been this it could have been the

same scene if there if different non-profit organizations and different organizations which uh you

know serve for humanitarian purposes they are not there it could have happened alternate parallel universe

um the one thing is that schools would be going on yeah restaurants would be going on and

colleges would be going on the worst i feel for those people who are in their like let us say 10th 11 12 standard

or in their colleges i think we the 90s kid had it the best out of the bunch you know why

because we are aware of the internet we know how to use it the best

and also our careers got settled for example my batch passed out in 2022 graduated

and then had a sufficient time of four years to establish careers

and then this happens and then we have the skill of the new brain and understanding of the internet and the online world at the same time

an experience of settling a career for example let us say you are in any field but you

got four years time to sink your feet in over there for example my friends like shivam and all

they have established their career a lot of them have got promoted also so they have created their value in the

industry on the contrary people who have not graduated they just got that theoretical

experience and now they are out in the world and now people are not hiring

so what happens now to them right yeah it's very sad you know things could have

been uncontrollable i think when if we would have not locked down is it yeah

we would have not gone for this lockdown then it would have spread it more uh disastrously

if that is a correct word disastrously yeah whatever it is so i think um

thanks would be severe that's my take more people dying and over time there

one thing that lockdown is for sure helped us in is that they gave us time

to prepare for more beds more vaccines like that workforce getting india's uh

you know india is getting criticized for that that you we had almost one

one year for the second year before the second wave was coming we had but we didn't

prepare it that much every other country is doing good on that i'm hearing about things in delhi like people are back to

normal as if not even the covert but second wave also did not happen everyone is

back on the street we personally have not gone outside at all today we went out because she had to

go to parlor for must it was related to a shoot and all yeah and i just went out to

buy some stuff and we every time we go outside we have to kick the scooty right because it has

been standing over there for for 14 15 days or so because that's

how less it has been used yeah wait wait for months i guess because um

i think you and i went out uh for vaccination yeah right and that two by cab we went

and before that we went out for a shoot i think the last time that what was that

yeah yeah so people should stay at home i think but they won't because because

but in bangalore you know things are like that that people are taking it very seriously

give me an example can you can you can't you see the streets and all right today i went out it is quite empty

right but there's there are changes as your friend told you that on delhi it's completely buzzing it's

completely crowded again yeah but the same thing we guys anyone from delhi let us know down in if you're on we're

not sure that the information he got that is from third source and that

is a person who is native of delhi only yeah and his parents and all are living over there

but yeah that is something to be taken notice of but my side also my father is like

roaming around taking a walk but then it depends on the population also you know if if it is a metropolitan city then you

have to take more care because there are more people per square feet right yeah yeah so it

becomes much more important over there and that is the prime reason why it started spreading in the big cities first for example

mumbai yeah because also maybe like international airport is there

and yes that is the reason for that obviously we can't claim me that it happened you

know in internally it must have someone would have come from foreign land

and spread it over here unintentionally that's how all the diseases are spread

yeah so mumbai a lot of foreigners come over there directly they land over there so maybe it can be the scene yeah true true

yeah but i'm happy about vaccination i'm seeing the pace increasing

isn't it now two three days i'm seeing over here in bangalore because i'm getting lot of messages

can we take the name now of the group that vaccinate yeah it is it is name of name of it is even even

yeah it is good they are very organized they are doing it on a very professional weekly basis yeah and they injected us

we got the fever and nothing bad happened to us so you can we can we are the lab rats who are

getting tested by that so it can be trustable and i think the cost is minimum

rest of the places it is 9.50 or so yeah they are not taking commission they are saying that it is no profit no

loss and they are doing it at 750. yeah okay that is a good place if

you are in bangalore i do not know if it is outside bangalore as well and you are not able to get slots

because i think the situation is worst in bangalore when it comes to getting the slots because a lot of my friends in mumbai

are getting easily vaccinated from government sources a lot of my friends and rachel also they're getting vaccinated easily delhi

also my place also yeah my brother got vaccinated very easily yeah yeah so but we were searching hunting

for any slot in bangalore but whether yeah and

the thing is that they were saying about the third wave somewhere in october so a lot of news is heading up and making

the headlines that maybe in two to four weeks you can see the third wave and delta and all

i don't know i saw the headline only yeah that is the problem with headline comal that you will read the one which is very

attractive and nobody actually cares about the source yeah but i've seen you know in in youtube you get

recommendations right there were series of recommendations where the same thing was

getting discussed because my friend also discussed the same thing that covered wave the third wave is going to hit us

maybe in october and yeah depending on the region the thing is that you watch one video and similar

videos will be recommended to you it's not like that that i watch that video the one which you get recommended

sometimes in youtube yeah i understand i understand that i never watched it but

if even if i'll open your account you'll get you'll be yeah i know i know that is promoted by youtube itself i think that

news and all right okay it makes sense there was a lot of fear regarding a vaccination when it comes to whether

you are injecting something that will be changing or dna or not well i don't think that one injection

can do that but then again i'm not a biologist or something so anything can happen

anything can happen not comment on that that would that would require way too much research man i don't think that

they can all of a sudden come with that research don't you think no no maybe like if you if you want to

intentionally do something to all the human beings will the small amount of time will be sufficient to

do all that research and all the vaccination companies are doing

that regardless you never know but this we can't deny the fact that it is getting misused also

right how yeah a lot of people are getting caught okay uh fake accidents yeah yeah that is

true that is true that happens fake vaccines are happening so you should definitely be

and that is what we were scared of yeah matter of fact man how easy it happened if that is

something that made us suspicious because like we have talked about before karthix has sent us

the link and he sent us at night and then i woke up and checked it out after two hours or so and said that let's give it a try

and then i went out over there paid 750 registered i said what how how can that happen

that is less uh recognized yeah that might be the thing yeah but that's what i was saying that

that made me suspicious as well that okay it can't be that easy it said no if it is too good to be true

it ain't and you know to add to your happiness we made one vlog also out of it yeah

yeah yeah we haven't i made basically always the credit trusted always always the credit goes to

commerce kamal is the bubbly one but i have in my hard drive

4. General talk

at least six seven blocks that are supposed to go on amalgam because there's a blog of the

whole her shoot also the palais yeah tvc shoot and i'm in negotiation negotiation with

some good brand also yeah like i've said before beware komal is going to skyrocket very

soon so far two agencies she has rejected one very recently

so yeah a lot of agencies are snooping in as well but i don't know maybe like i'm still in

dilemma yeah she's still in dilemma but she's getting that much that is great carmel carmel you want to

bring some topic yeah i had like as promised in the last time in

i was telling you know one question which you would like which you would like us to discuss that

was does religion unite or divide so two to three people said yes

like discuss it yeah yeah so we can discuss that what are your ideas on that be a little

bit closer to mike i think you're a little bit too far away a little a little low in your voice um too much

comfortable i guess today sitting idle like this be comfortable it's your podcast

yeah by the way momentum podcast is skyrocketing because now people themselves are

approaching that i want to be on momentum podcast

so next week i'm recording five momentum podcast that is this thursday thursday i'm having two and

saturday you can see over here it is written over there right so saturday also two

and i think friday also i'm going to record one like that also we are planning something from

welcome to what okay don't reveal for amalgam i'm

forgetting something what is that okay let's discuss it all right but i'm thinking of bringing komal on momentum podcast because it has

i didn't know that it has been a while komal you were over there in sixth episode you know that podcast has gotten one lakh views

as the most famous momentum podcast i have ever made we just started recording it abruptly

you know what that podcast is actually very informative the topic that we talked about over there no science

versus engineering i don't know i just talked whatever knowledge i didn't even research more whatever knowledge i had i

just pitted it out it is a good combination an engineer and a science student talking about the career opportunities

after two to three years of them graduating that's a very nice combination i'm not talking about us only

anybody who's gonna uh advise you it's better that you uh take advice from

someone uh who uh like who's if someone is from engineer background and someone is from

a science background they both are sitting together and they are advising you then i think that is gonna help you in a

long time yeah yeah all right so let us get to the topic of does religion unite or divide yeah what

5. Does religion unite or divide

do you think um what do you want to start with i

think religion was meant to unite us

but the power has been misused and it has been misused whatever power

comes it always has the ability to get misused and we are humans we love to play with

powers in a negative way and that's what we did the religion it's such a beautiful thing

it was meant to you know flourish it was people how to live yeah it was uh meant

the propaganda ultimately whatever religion you are following the uh no religion tells you to

you know create havoc and wreck havoc and uh you know uh it promotes only

peace harmony love do good things to others help us you know some when people think about

the negative thoughts i think religion is something which keeps them hold back

remember remember if you are suppose if uh if you are doing something that uh okay uh if you see uh suppose two

thousand rupees note on a street so you will be like okay whether i should pick it up or not i should pick

it up or not i'm talking about a general human tendency right so i'm not talking about

our personal opinions okay all right but that person uh tendency would be like he would

maybe he or she would definitely give uh you know thought that maybe i should

pick it up but i think religion is something which they are following religion by means the what

they are following it's not something which is defined whatever your ethics are also religion i

feel yeah you know what my mother used to say if you finally let me complete i should otherwise i'll lose my chain

great go ahead i'm extremely sorry commentary yeah we'll start from there only your mother

okay yeah so i think uh what happens that uh that person

will get hold back by the religion religion when i say religion it can be your ethics also that okay i don't want

to take that you know money from someone or like that i'll be you know i'll be nice person

i'll walk on the path of honesty i'll be a true person to myself and to others too

so i think the religion is a very beautiful concept and that was meant to flourish the

humanity and the mankind but it has been misused in in in the

worst ways i can like any other good thing yeah it has it has been misused to you know uh to create

different differences between two communities say for example in india also

in muslims and the main conflict is between muslims and hindus

right we see riots happening but there was a time when hindus and

muslim they used to live together and then british britishers came and they just came up with this divide and

rule policy and all the great leaders this mahatma gandhi and everyone was in favor of

uh hindu and muslim living together nobody dreamt of a of a in india where communities will be

different and they'll be completely you know they'll be completely opposite and they'll be uh you know they'll be standing against

each other but in the recent times we have seen such riots whether it can be you know that ayodhya

case or ramander case like some things have ignited some sparks

i think that has added us fuel in creating uh indifferences and the rights what's

your take you can start with your mother no no i'll get back to that because i was talking about the thing that you

were talking about at that time okay i think people use the religion

to to make the religion fail itself like they are doing exactly what the

religion tells you not to do and by doing that they are gaining power they are gaining money

they are gaining control what i was saying over there was that like i was saying that my mother was

religious and she always always used to say that if you find a note of money lying on the

floor take it and give it to charity or give it i always do the same actually

give it to someone poor i'm not saying that i'd do that but that's what i do that you know i

just i matter of fact i just realized i've never found any money fallen anymore you know several times

you are one lucky one that is the reason there is a reason komal finds it gods give it

to her every now and then by the way just you know just by the way just to clarify how

honest i am no no just to clarify none of us are actually religious that is another thing

that they should be knowing you know i'm a very you know i'm a very you know empathetic

person what is that like the one who carries love for others oh empathetic yeah so you know i remember one instance

from my life where i was maybe i was in 7th or 8th standard where i observed a child get lost

in my city only nobody knows my mom dad my brother nobody knows that i'm revealing it over here

that when child got lost and me and my friend her name was gurya so we just found that

that child and we were we thought that he's completely lost because nobody was with him mostly he was boy and then we

went from home to home asking whether you know this guy whether you know this guy and we literally helped him reach his home and

my mom afterwards maybe like i just made some excuse that i got hooked up by that or that that

just that just reminds me of that movie lion man if you if you have watched that movie

you will not let anyone who is very young let ever get out of your sight

6. General talk

the way that i got goosebumps the way that he traveled from madhya pradesh to west bengal west bengal yeah kolkata

right and the problems that he faced it just happened that he turned out to be very lucky and that's a true story

that's a true story the person is alive he has written a book right and he is still there having two

mothers yes so guys basically we watch two movies in our david together watch two movies

miracles from heaven and the lion yeah miracles from heaven man see if you have a problem that i'm not

able to cry these days definitely was that you are going to be it's very bad

bad is happening my life it's always i don't know why every time bad things

happen to me just watch miracles or if if you think that man life is too good these days i'm way too much happy man i

want some sadness watch that movie you're going to get a lot of that i was

crying continuously i was wiping out my tears again the next moment i just thought that

okay now i'm not crying i'm strong now and the next moment again my tears are rolling down my cheeks

and then i just went uh to a room and then i just got the tissue paper rolling and i thought

that it was going to happen throughout the movie suggestions pro tips yeah which also reminds me

come on so also very emotional why don't you mention that no comment so here's the

thing i don't cry no you don't cry i've never cried actually

no no i don't cry i'm so awesome i have never cried

this is this is what most of the guys would like to this is

this is how like this it goes like this actually you have this one also by the

way this is my left hand i can't do it like that we got this from mumbai

i'm sorry right we have never given him credit actually yeah but you know how diversely

diversified we are like from the one topic to another topic yeah yes we can continue with the story

which story yeah how did we get this we got this from goa i'm forgetting the guy's name so

most probably is it okay no he subscribed to our youtube channel immediately so maybe he watches our

video i told him that your your thing is going to go on that board and people are going to be able to

watch it it is it was arjuna beach what was it anjuna beach right and they make their

own things for example that bike and all know it is nothing but nuts and bolts welded together

so as a mechanical engineer that is what attracts me the most and it is creativity for example you can get where

is that one i'll have to bring it then if you want to see it sometimes i have it sometimes i don't oh

my goodness what happened okay it is not an issue

yeah not an issue for you i see yeah yeah so basically that guy

became so happy like when you see such small small things it may not

impact you but from for me as a person and to ashish also

i think it means a lot these small small things yeah by by the time that we went to the next shop

we heard him playing my videos so this is a bike so if you can see it

properly it is a ball bearing over here that is playing the part of the wheel and it is

spring which is playing the part of a silencer and then all the parts are just

small metal particles that you can find thrown in the waste or something and

each of them are handmade like this is another bolt over here and these are all welded together

so this is something that you can't just buy on amazon right and ashish can buy you know 5000

rupees also for this kind of thing i've seen him spending that much yeah i said just name the price i'm taking

three of these because this is this is a must-have for a mechanical engineer if you find it

there are few few values that you're supposed to yeah also this is such a great idea to support such vendors yeah

right that's it it's it's supporting supporting the craft plus he was so nice to us yeah yeah

yeah that is great i don't know why i'm just getting this texas accent little

bit because you've been watching way too much of jenny and georgia

you should not watch that i do not regret that i would love to have she has was two times don't don't and

maybe and from now and every now and then i just keep hopping on this clips small small clips on instagram

oh yeah save them too the worst is on youtube so for example friends know i have kind

of watched the entire friends without watching it on netflix properly because i started

watching few clips this is back then when i was in bic training school so i just for time pass i used to watch

these one or two minute and youtube just bombards you with further more of such clips and you can imagine 12 seasons right

there are 12 seasons in france and okay 10 seasons each and each and every one of them are having i think

10 12 episodes i don't know whatever this huge amount of content and then one minute of how many clips can be

formed right and it just got shown in my youtube recommendation again again i kept on

watching it so in a similar manner on installs whatever you watch they're going to show you more of that

yeah so yeah but jenny and georgia is definitely recommended it is a good story and the characters

definitely correct is the way they are built up amazing yeah but

then again i hate the part when there are certain writers

who just knows how to elongate the story and keep you home the same happened maybe the same happened and

same can happen in the case of jinny georgia also that is what i'm saying that is what i'm saying like it that that tv series sunflower

that we watched same thing no this yeah same thing they just know how to

elongate the whole thing yeah they just we were so excited to watch this we were literally said reminders that

okay two days left one day left and it is good but there is no story

more than average yeah more than good like whatever hear some you know some bad moves also

does some good work on the box office box office don't even talk about that

like over here it can be two in imdb and then making 300 400 times the profit like that

so but after the whole situation when the theaters are shutting down that is a completely different story i

don't know what it is going to happen yeah in america i heard one story where

some where you are allowed to remove your mass you can texas texas in theaters correct in texas

no no no it's not like that in texas it is your choice so if you want to wear masks i think the

mayor of texas said that but if you want you can wear the mask if you don't

it is not necessary it's not compulsive then i'm talking about another news there might be other states as well yeah

but that is what i heard in the joe rogan podcast he is right now in texas so i heard that

but there might be other states as well so it is united states of america is crazy

it is basically like truly what it is named after it is united states only so different states are different

different taxes different rules everything is different over there matter of fact a lot of states will be

having different languages as well and different states will definitely be having different

accents for example texas accent yeah but that that's you know that sounds so

tempting guys i'll recommend you one more movie it's forrest gump

watch it it is amazing that is again a guy who is based on texas only but it is a fun movie did i show you a

little bit part of it where he had crutches and then he started running and then his feet came back

and then he kept on running running and he got selected in football then he got into army

it is a different kind of writing but then again by past 50 percent of it it became kind of

like boring they are trying to show everything in that okay let us move back to the topic religion unites or

divide we went way away from the topic i've talked down talked

7. Every power will be misused

all right so it is just like anything good you have it will be destroyed by

the human nature whatever you have but then again everything gets tainted over time for

for example these days new and new things are popping up like scientology is coming up there are

different things that okay i believe in this yeah but that is the problem

with human beings is that we want to belong to a particular community

okay this is my country this is my religion these are my people it makes us feel better and there's no

human who can actually escape that but that is something that i think smarter people will capitalize on

if they are having an evil mind so for example speaking so yesterday only i was having a session

of artists certainly ma'am let me know how it is so

yesterday only i was having the third session of heart of speaking which is on public speaking so i showed them the power of speaking

so i showed them the first example which was adolf hitler and the second example which was nelson

mandela so both of these people i asked them a simple question

what are they using what is the main power what are they doing right now how did

they influence so many people speaking so the same power can be used in two different direction one

brings war to an entire continent or a lot will say to the entire world and

the other one brings peace to an entire country and same goes throughout the history

so whatever you have that can be used as good as bad as well but the problem is that both

kind of people are there in the world and both kind of people there are certain people who are smarter

than the rest so obviously if you're smarter and then you have an inclination of money and

power then you can be using the same thing for example youtube also a lot of people are using it just for

the sake of money i'm not saying i'm not going to say that they want to destroy the mentality of youth or something like

that but what they are doing they're tremendous speakers but they're using the whole

crowd and brainwashing the whole crowd don't know what kind of mentality they are putting into kids and they are having

millions and millions of followers and people follow those people blindly

that is the thing and it's happening the power of clickbait clickbaits and then they are going to

say what people want to listen yes like some you know

some unreal realities what do you say unreal yeah i don't know what you're talking

about though they'll they'll present you which is not real they'll present you you know something yeah because reality

it's harsh and nobody wants to listen to it yeah and they'll feed you with something which is you know tell them like this is in 10

minutes you can learn how to multiply your money 50 times something like that and majority of the people

want that hey komal i'm going to give you a pill and you're going to become super rich in three days and most people in this world will say

give me that pill who wants to work hard for the next five years right so that is what you capitalize on

and the biggest problem let us take the example of socrates i was talking about this before the

greek empire gave us two great things number one philosophy and the second one is democracy

socrates a philosopher of grace was dead against democracy and his idea was that do

voting do it all give power to common people no problem in that but give power to educated common people

they should have the right to work but they should have proper education of who they are voting for

otherwise the people who are getting the votes or collecting the votes can easily play them and influence them into

voting into a particular direction right yeah yeah so that is how it all works

majority of the people are not that smart and majority of the people can be

influenced like this and because of this lot of things happens civil war happens

entire world goes into war nuclear bomb drops a lot of things happen because they're smarter people who know

that majority of the people can be influenced very easily and this is very very visible

in today's day as well everywhere not only on internet everywhere why is tick-tock so

famous or right now it is not in india but it was there why but it's still famous

it's still famous in other countries why are reels so famous why are there new apps replicating tick tock coming up

every next day because it is in demand why because majority of the people enjoy that why

why do you think that educational channels are straight up in the gutter all the

educational channel you go to any educational channel where you will be finding content on physics chemistry mechanical engineering

people are teaching people are accomplished and then teaching over there they're hitting 200 300 views not

picking up against carrying minority but kalimanathi makes a roast video on big boss and it gets 15 million views

within couple of days or sometimes within couple of hours what is the reason for that that's what

majority wants and it's a big problem that's where the problem of likes and views and all these comes into

the picture but what are you looking at okay this is more popular but tell me pareto 80 20 rule

applies everywhere eighty percent of the population will be having twenty percent of the wealth twenty percent of the

population will be more intellectual and my my teacher once said that 10

of the population will be the one leading 80 percent will be in the middle and 10 percent will be straight up

destructive and then these these population that are in the center are the fence sitters

and it depends on the leaders what they do yes ashish you were telling no that smart people i think smart people

are the one who are mostly leading right yeah and the smart i think they have mastered the philosophy to that

extent that they can play with your philosophy it is not a difficult philosophy common actually it is not like you have to be a

genius to understand letters yes you are studying that creator we are also creators

for example i don't understand what clickbaits are can't i make clickbaits what is bollywood doing right now making

movies that make zero sense showing those love stories that does not exist is it difficult no

it's not anyone understands that common people will love that and majority will enjoy that and you'll sell a lot of

tickets maybe we can say that a lot of people want to live in the fantasy world they do but that is as a society not

constructive for us yeah and we like adding to that lot of girls they like kid dramas

i don't know about that yeah why is it when you'll ask them that why do you like it because of the you know the captivating

love story and for a girl maybe the guy he's so gentlemen that they so it's all fantasy

world that they are uh longing for it they are designing for it yeah right so that shows the reflection if you are if

you are too attached to it and if you are just going through it day and night and i have seen such people

so it means you are designing for the same corner of your heart reality is too

boring for most people yeah and and for us also like every now and then everything man this planet is

way too boring only one moon bad every now and then

every now and then i would look at it every now and then i would look at the sky and man there are there's only one moon over

there but then again it is boring because you have lived over here for way too long and then you have seen

people making movies on mars and uranus like watch it from moon and you'll realize yeah so is

fantasy really bad because we love naruto we love game of thrones earth and moon i

8. Ashish is a fan of Neil DeGrasse Tyson

think we should come again with some space reality yeah it has been a while yeah we have

not been talking it maybe since 10 15. i've been talking about it on spacecast

yeah but i'm talking about tamalgamashi yes we should come up with some topic yes

and we should bring komal on space car someday no only that is going to be disastrous all right

but komal can you imagine someday neil degrasse tyson comes in space cast that would be amazing yeah

i believe i completely believe in your capabilities and i know that he can come for sure i need

to believe if you'll tell that one day i won't be surprised i actually mailed him so what neil

degrasse tyson does know he has some certain random guests on his podcast

who can ask questions from him astrophysics kind of questions or rocket science kind of questions so i mailed him man get me over there i

want to ask a couple of questions but there is no response so it is a sad world after all

maybe you can keep pinging no no no maybe i can keep on making more potters yeah i'm certainly a

fanboy of him because i'm right now going through his book as well accessories of war

9. Back to does religion unite or divide

and all you are going to find out now you are if you go through that book you are going to certainly understand

why is ashish obsessed with both rocket science and history because in that book throughout

throughout the book he's just going through history throughout the book he's just going through how military has

continuously used astrophysics and how astrophysics was majorly funded by

military post world war post civil war post american revolution it was always

there everywhere he has even shown connection of how telescope was is now majorly used

for looking at distant stars and hubble telescope will be the most extended

example of that but it was primarily at that time used and now still is used to a huge extent by military to

get the information from a huge distance he also talks about other things of how stars are were used

to navigate and it immediately got implemented in naval combat of ships and all yeah so

that is what humans again any power they get they apply applied for something bad

always yeah same goes for a lot ground circle towards religion also so

it religion is the most strong thing in this world powerful tool that can be misused and if

you get misused it can literally you know all hell can break loose

and it has happened multiple times for example what was the whole thing in world war ii they

were straight up wiping out one religion they were imposing their jews yeah that's it and um

you you can see that throughout the history there are a lot of different religions for example

israel palestine also hugely yeah yeah because of that so ultimately what

is happening people are dying a lot of people are losing their livelihood loved ones and the person who actually

started the war and the whole thing safe and sound a lot of nazis

escaped from germany to argentina after the world war ended they understood what they have to do they understood that

their cash and their money is not going to be useful they immediately converted into diamond and gold which is very portable

they flew to germa sorry flew to argentina it's as simple as that they killed millions and they are safe

they're they are fighting for germany right germany is invaded by one side from russia another side from america

and allied forces and all their houses are distracted but the people who actually started it all

they are safe they're doing well correct so that is the thing the people who are at

the top will use the power and what is war at the end of the day who decides to go and invade another

country and did you ever ever ask a question that there are going to be people who

are going to be dying because of your decision and that how is it different from murder

it's just that the trigger is not in your finger that's it yeah yeah yeah so any power

can be certainly misused and that is what people are afraid about ai as well artificial intelligence that

okay this is another power that is what people are afraid of internet space power also space power

that is that is definitely something which has to be taken care of which is going to be very big

and you know a lot of people are investing in that you can see jeff bezos is on a new plan is in pursuit of

you know making a new business where he'll be promoting the space tourism don't you

think so yeah that is one thing but then again the problem comes when it comes to the satellite and all

like you can literally that is the secondary things the main thing is how people

still like things are not planned right but still from where they have started planning

that how they'll be you know they'll be planning and how they'll be taking no it is very simple

like you cannot live without space technology you won't be able to talk to people at such

distances without that but that is again a power and it can be easily misused

it is used by other countries to spy on other countries you can obviously have a nuclear warhead

on a satellite and drop it on any other country whenever you want and they're certainly working on that technology

and there are so many satellites getting launched for example the recent ula launch fail that happened

was having a payload by united states which was undisclosed they are not going to give you any

information what it is having what is going to be the orbit matter of fact they won't even disclose what is the

weight of it they are so secret and there's so huge amount of secrecy about this so obviously the misuse has

started at some point or the other and the biggest problem is that go to any country and ask them

where is the highest amount of investment of your gdp going and the answer if it does not shake you

military obviously yeah obviously in every country the highest budget goes over there which

i'm not saying is unnecessary if if you just open the walls terrorists are going to walk in

and the civilians are going to die i understand that but this nuclear power that a lot of countries

are having for example another funny story we have talked about russia and ukraine you know so ukraine was part of russia and russia

had nuclear nuclear power since 1947 so ukraine also had but when ussr

disintegrated in 1991 then ukraine was a different country now a separate country but still having

nuclear technology right and then they said that remove your nuclear warheads and arsenal

because from now on you are going to be a country which does not have nuclear power and for that russia will support you if

you remove your nuclear energy power nuclear missiles and all russia will support you from any other war

next thing what we see in 2013 russia invades crimea this is a part of ukraine yeah and still

what is going on right so why is not every country removing their nuclear

warheads why is not every country just denuclearizing their entire country to

maintain the terror yeah there's a problem there's a problem

that different if you remove your nuclear energy or nuclear missiles then what happens if other country does

not right so we humans are having huge amount of misconnections

in between us none of us want to have that but we are bound to have that matter of fact it is

much more difficult to have nuclear bombs in your country it is much more expensive and dangerous

to maintain those to have those you've seen that in bach no i've not seen that embargo not

seen with eyes but like you have realized that all right yeah i have seen how they protect the nuclear elements

for example uranium and all how thick glass shield i've gone to red zone once so people who do not know the

nuclear wherever there is something nuclear present there will be certain zones and red zone

is the most dangerous one because over there if you get the radius and radiation it will be dangerous

that means that you are literally a few feet away from uranium and all so i know how much how much of

infrastructure it requires to keep it all protected and sealed and all and also often it has happened that the

nuclear nuclear missile or arsenal or some kind of warhead actually dropped on a place while transporting it

you know i can show you pictures and all of that as well you want to see so it is very very dangerous

to maintain that to keep that and we are at a state where nuclear missiles and

all it is quite obvious that even if a single country launches a nuclear weapon as small as it might be

everyone throws it and everything goes to apocalypse right and now they are having in submarines and

all and stealth submarines you won't even realize it is right near your country yeah yeah so yeah it is all weird

freaks me out of thinking about all these things but guys thank you for tuning in for talking

five podcasts you can put your suggestions down below in the comment section if you happen to be

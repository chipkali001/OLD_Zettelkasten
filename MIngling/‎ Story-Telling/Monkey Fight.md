Aim - Bravery, Courage, FIGHTING SPIRIT, WHEN OTHERS COWER you DON’T, Se USE in WARRIOR FASHION

1. First other cowered and ran away. **courage**
2. I didn’t cuz i saw (opportunity) You saw - SO MUCH MOMENTUM FORWARD. If i throw. IT’LL BE BRUTAL  **(Se SHOW)**
3. **Monkey ran out of dirt smog like movie**

4. Now time for run. WE RAN. My house nearest. EVERYONE RAN TO MY HOUSE
5. Now what happened Left turn i hsd to monkey direct diagonal (show how it was like with objects around you to explain relative )
6. EVERYONE attached to door, ASKIN MOM DAD to open up, pushing each other to remain closer. 

7. I was still little away from door cuz monkey took diagonal to overtake me.
8. Monkey looking at them, **THEY WERE ALL SUPER NOISY (your calmness in distress show)**
9. I went to them, realize monkey isn’t looking in my direction and it’s not good to stay in corner. I circled smoothly (**YOUR Se & Darness FLAUNT - instead of curbing into ball like them**)

10. ==STAR== - Along with noticing monkey’s not looking at me
	- I saw Monkeys direction hand grip, body’s rigidity 
> [!Attention] Monkey just was in VULNERABLE POSITION, I don’t know how to EXPLAIN but my INSTINCTS pushed me that i should attack him - IT WAS JUST FEELING'


==11==. 
	Took few step forward, 
	Then put one of my leg forward in lean
	READY to ATTACK QUICK & ESCAPE
	Why not push? Show push HAND MOVEMENTS vs Bicep CURL REVERSE JERK PUNCH SLAP (hand swing looks less elegant and smart) 
	YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE STRENGTH this movement has
	MONKEY WAS BIG, RIGIDLY holding, so IMPACT will be enhanced
	
==12==. NOW FROM HERE it may look like WHY ATTACK? RECKLESS? - but you have to realise 
	1. it’s difficult to narrate intensity of situation 
	2. Monkey was heavy & big
	3. I’m 7-9 yr old 
	4. Chize bho tfast hui, instant phekna out of instinct, then running monkey overtaking me **HE IS DISTRACTED NOW cuz OF NOISE but HE CAN TURN ANY MOMENT**
	5. *It was IMPULSE, like if try to move my hands near you in slapping punching pushing whatever it’s NATURAL INSTINCT FIRST TO PUT YOUR HAND FORTH & Defend SELF*

13. 
> [!Example] ==EVERYTHING of that punch is INGRAINED in SLOW MOTION==
14. Just at that instant i gained AWARNESS FUCk what i’m doing, I ATTACKED OUT OF IMPULSE without any thinking.
15. BECAUSE OF that - my hand nearly grazed his eyes And monkey didn’t even notice? 

16. I was shocked?  ==monkeys eyes looked out of focus he wasn’t looking at anyone in group==

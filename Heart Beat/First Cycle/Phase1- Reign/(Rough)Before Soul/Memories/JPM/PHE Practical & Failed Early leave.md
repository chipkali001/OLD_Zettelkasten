*After physics practical i was waiting in class getting bored, i didnt bring phone, i may have called my parents & asked them to come get me & Boredom took better of me, i marched of went to sir and asked him that i want to go to reeption to call my parents.
Sir told me that mam isnt there in reception, even if i go i willnt find anyone, defeated i returend to my seat.*
Way to insert this story along with physics practical is by saying well after physics practical i was gettign bored & was getting boredi n hcmeistry too same thigns & & well you see… 
BUT NEXT TIME on chemistry practical i bought my phone & messaged mom to send dad to come pick me up & i was reading novel, after 5-10min minute i checked message i saw
Mothers message “XYZ uncle (from fathers office) is coming”
I had bad feeling, i expected that reception-mam will drive him back cuz cuz 
becoz last time in PHE practical exam day, there were nearly 100+ students combined of all sections of all streaams. i didnt had patience to wait for that long for when all students will be done & then we will  be allowed to go home, so what i did is admist the chaos, i sneaked out from ground (when sir wasnt looking), **I DIDNT TAKE SIR’S PERMISSION BOZ THERE WAS an EXAMINER from OUTSIDE so it will be TOO TROUBLESOME.** picked my bag & went directly to reception office.
I told mam I want to call my parents, my PHE done.
So while i was waiting for my father to come, i happened exchange between reception-mam & teacher-sir.
Sir was saying that school facilitating cheating is neccesary good grades and kids passing to which mam responded by saying that kids when they will go work in future they will spread word of how they cheated in school & that will negatively affect repuation of school.
AND I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS, I wasnt looking at their faces BUT I KNEW that this mam wouldnt allow uncle to come & take me & the only reason that day i was able to run away CUZ MAM wouldnt have imagined I JUST SNEAKED OUT when exam was happening & RAN AWAY here.

From that type of exchange i had an idea of mam’s personality and i knew she willnt allow bhiya to just sweep me off.
the only reason i was able to escape early was cuz i just acted as if sir gave me permission & try to act assertive & confident.
Bhiya who father send was squishy type of person, mam will surely drive him off.
AND My mother should have asked him to pretend to my CHACHA or something., they dont even have common sense that you cant just send random bhiya.






MY Mother was angry that i think i am VIP of sorts & have too much pride BUT i simply had perspective
Since i am DUMMY STUDENT, never came kind of an anomaly if i assert myself they willnt fight, & teacher will be kind to new student who came for first time, because they too dont know how to treat with anomaly

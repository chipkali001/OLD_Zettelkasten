You say don't take it seriously but what you say is very right :  E proximity (bring chin close to chest when talk (like sumo)), I distance(towering, looking from above), N eyes move, S eyes direct, F agreable-friendly-warm, T confident-respect_evoking, P gesture toward inside while talk, J gesture toward outside

======================
I have noticed that facial features also give a lot of data on one's type. I've found a lot of correlations in people's appearances. 

INTJ- sunken in and dull/relaxed eyes, eyebrows directed towards the middle of their eyes and kind of a, what I call- mountainous side profile (sunken eyes, big protruding long nose, basically lots of ups and downs), thick lips

ENTP- sharp eyes (looks very open and attentive), flat face, wide mouth, square or circular face, thin nose. Eyebrows parellel to eyes. Thin lips

INTP- same as ENTP but narrower mouth and long oval/rectangular face. 

ENTJ- same as INTJ but more pronounced chin and sharper eyes. Shark-like appearance and thin lips.

INFP- eyebrows either parallel to eyes or falling off (lower from the outer side and higher around the middle), rounder face, thick lips and rounded average/broad nose.

INFJ- long face, sunken in eyes but quite wide. Rounded nose, big forehead, well defined facial bone structure

ENFP- square faces, wide mouths, often have a grin on their face. Rounded but short noses.

I haven't made much observations of the rest. I'm from India so my observations are mostly of people of the north Indian races which is kind of related to caucasian races. It's going to be different for every race and ethnicity but this is what I've noticed among light-brown to light skin people.

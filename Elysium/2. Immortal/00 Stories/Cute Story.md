As a little girl, I’d always be fast asleep when we pulled into our driveway late at night after being out as a family. My father would unbuckle me and scoop me up to bring me inside. By the time I was five, I was often awake when we pulled in but I’d pretend to be asleep because I loved the comfort of being Scooped into my dad’s arms and whisked into the house. Once, when I was probably near six year old, my dad did his ritual extraction of the kid  from the back seat and he leaned over and whispered tenderly in my ear
“I know what you’re doing and this is the last time.” 



My toddler thinks he fools me when he pretends to be asleep. I see that smile with your eyes squinted close.



My 19 year old Son thinks I don’t know he smokes weed. Lmfao children please, you can’t fool a master.



I found the box of girl guide cookies that my 8 year old daughter  had taken from our pantry and put it in one of her toy boxes.  i Didn’t gave crap about it; just took them back and ate them all.



MY toddler has a “secret”  hiding spot in the corner. When she thinks I’m not looking, she’ll hide snacks there and then ask for more so she can have extra crackers. It’s hilarious, but I can already tell she is going to be handful.



In school hsotel before 6th class. All kid used to sleep in one warden

After class 6,  two-three kids in one room.


Having older sisters is annoying . They are just annoying creatures that take space in your habitat.
Finding clumps of hair in sink, them using your comb, leaving clothes on the floor , ignoring your privacy, when using perfume they only get hit by 20% of it, the rest flows into room choking all living organism, trying to order you around, as a slave, getting completely irrational at times.

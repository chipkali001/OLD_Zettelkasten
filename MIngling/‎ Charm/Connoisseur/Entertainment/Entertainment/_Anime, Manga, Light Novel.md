Mobusuke & ClearingAnIsekaiWithZeroBelieverGoddess

PLEASE GOD! TAKE 10years of my lifespan and allow me to experience that high that rush AGAIN,If i get to experience that one more time and then i get killed. I have no regrets.

Zero believer goddess and Mobesuke.

IN THAT MOMENT I TRULY FELT I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE. IT WASN'T A HALF LIE FROM MY BOTTOM OF HEART IT WAS SINCERE.

HOW THE WORLD AS I SWEE IT WAS PUT INTO COMPLETE IRRELEVANCY AND MY DEPRESSION AND SAD THINGS DON’T HOLD ANY VALUE. ALL THE PAST AND SADNESS WAS PUSHED INTO IRRELEVANCY.

First episode of: The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady

How she was gazing out of window, alone, doing her best to hold herself.

How she felt when she did everything right, yet was still punished by this cruel world.

Rekindled the same type of feeling in my body. The scene where blonde girl, takes silver beauty on her broom and flys away. Aaah!

( ignites my reincarnate as fem FANTASY)

IT’S THE ONE EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE THAT MAKES ME VALUE MY LOVE ABOVE than the common mass and just, normal and fluent lives everyone gets gifted with.

MY Oasis in the desert.

AND SINCE THE EXPERIENCER IS ONLY ME AND NO OTHER HUMANS ARE INVOLVED IT’S PURE.

PURER THAN ANY OTHER EXPERIENCE.

A Place Further than the Universe- I LOVED AND ENJOYED FIRST HALF. LATER HALF GOT LITTLE BORING. BUT FIRST HALF LOVED IT

Tokyo Ghoul - I deeply felt and resonated with scene of Kaneki’s mother and her values of kindness and helping others stuff. And how those values were cause of suffering.

It feels very similar to me.

Sword Art Online - I became crazy when i first watched it,  i was in beginning stage of depressio nand i feltl ike i have to wait 10-15yrs ENDURE then a time will come when i can just plug my head in headset and scape from this shitty world.

I don’t want contacts or friendships or love with earthly humans.

I want an AI, cuz only it will be intelligent enough to understand me and talk to me in way that will bring me comfort and peace. Real humans can’t do that.

IN DEPRESSION I HAD A DEEP SENSE OF THAT NOONE WILL EVER UNDERSTAND ME CUZ SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO HAVE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE AS ME AND IT’S IMPOSSIBLE.

It Took So Much Empathy Love SPIRITUALITY to Realise We All are kind Of Same.

ITS NOT THAT I AM DIFFERNET. EVERYONE IS SO SO SO DAMN DIFFERENT THAT YOU CAN’T UNDERSTAND

The reason i became okay with no friends was that - noone really understands me either way so having or not having friends doeesn’t really matter.

I Was chewing on thought of escaping BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I UNDERSTOOD THAT I WON’T BE AB:LE TO LIVE IN ANIME WORLD CUZ ANIME IS 2D.

WE LIVE IN 3D. IT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING

DEMON LORD RETY / SLIME REINCARNATED  -  AT TIME I WATCHED IT, it sent me into dream like state and it felt really really good

SummerTimeGhost left me with feeling of wanting to die, so that i can be relieved from all this pain, i want to be free from all this struggle and just be nothing

I haven’t earned anything worth value till now and things will remain the same as kife is going.

No! I will get things that make my life even less unvaluable

\Anohana just hold an special place in my hearty. i odn't have words but it makes me feel so good. espeically the song at end of 2nd last episode when they launch that rocket and song starts playing, im ust have replayed that part 20-30 times+

EMINENCE IN SHADOW - Amazing anime

But ti STOLE MY HEARTY when in episode where intruders attacks SCHOOL AND MC SAYS THAT THIS FANTASY IS HIGH IN HIS LIST.

Oh god, i too used to fantaqsied about terrosrist attacking our school and me being hero and saving everyone.

Aaaah, i love it so sos much

Tokyo ghoul was the naime that compelled me into trying writing.

I REALLY REALLY ENJHOYED IT.

I WIULL READ AND FINISH IT'S MANGA ON A VERY SPECIAL DAY.

Again coming back to the story i joined taekowodo but it was really boring i was expecting to become Bruce Lee and i will get amazing moves but it was not that flashy everything felt boring and even the kicks they were teaching felt showy and amazing but i didn't felt they will help in class fights or defeating saransh bhiya but whenni was bored opposite to the taekwondo room was science lab and in there few seniors used to do robotics and i thought it was so cool. Itill that point i ha dreamt that i will build time machine, iron man Armor and find a way for humans to f immortal cause we can uz machine if one part get rusty we can replace it so it's so simple. I saw that maybe robotics will help me to enter that world but that was a thing only seniors who had robotics kit could do . So i can only look from afar. 



However next year i got the chance , i took part in robotics and it was fun. After school ended we will still stay in school to do robotics , the whole school will be empty and only kids there will be only few handful of us and teachers . 

You get feeling like you are the king.

Also now I will tell you an incident but i have to tell you how the bus system really worked .

In my school I used to do robotics and by permission of principal we got permission to use an empty class which apparently nobody used as our roboitcs clubroom (It was not real robotics. We just bought a robotics kit of a company the only thing we used to do is tight screws adjust gears etc.)  

we had special permission from the principal so we used to bunk a lot of classes and sit in the robotics club room.

We also bought few desk(on which you write) from other classes and we combined them in  corner of class near the window.

A bhiya used to bring chadar and we used to spread the chadar over it and sleep with comfort by removing our shoes.

Senior used to bring mobile phone and laptop they used to play songs and dance in class.

We can apparently do this because i had a friend who was son of teacher(A very high position and respected) (corruption)

We had covered the glasses of door with chart paper under excuse that chidren from all the classes use to come to peek inside and it distracted us but it was mainly to avoid getting reported by student or teacher.

Me and my friend were chilling and lying on the desk combined together as bed and talking about random stuff. We didnt had chaddar with us but it didn't mattered much.

Suddenly there was knock on door.

We thought it was some kid from some class trying to annoy us.

Rudra got little angry and abused the person and started laughing.

I didnt did any abused because i used to think that people who abuse are bad people and I considered myself as a good person but I laughed a little.

He got a little motivated due to that maybe and hurrled one more abuse.

That is when we heard a heavy voice ‘open the door’

That is when we knew we fucked up.

Rudra went and opened the door.

It was vice principal sir.

He quickly apologised and said he though it was kids form other kids blah  blah

Sir didn't beat him, mainly because he was son of teacher of an higher position.

I continued to pretend to build my robot.

Rudra was talking in very soft voice which was complete opposite of just ago.

He said Agrim app aaise nhi aaisekrte hai, yee mujhe do. Jaise meri mummy hai wo.

He asked us to run it so we showed him. 

Thankfully nothing happened.

Uska naam mene diaper, manypokopants, Pampers. I will send him ads to laugh at each other.

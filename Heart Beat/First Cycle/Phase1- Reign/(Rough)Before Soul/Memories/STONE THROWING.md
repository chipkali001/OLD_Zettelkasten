# STONE THROWING
Story of 1st, 2nd  clasot think that why whould i choose to make my best-friend a sacrifice.

Answer -

Explain layout of gully and position of wall poster. Prepare alread rough layout 

(……..…..……………….layou description………..)

I used to live in baghpat, ek kasba/town

in childhood 

I had three friends 

Arpit , ayush, akshat bhaiya.

Let me tell you little detail about three.

Ayush was my bestfriend and i grew up with him and we went to same three school.

Akshat Bhiya- was my neighbour, so because of that we used to spend lot of time together, akshat bhiya and me playing video games, eating at each other house

Arpit was great friend and we had lot of common interest and he had a soft kind upright temperament. 

Now i used to quickly get bored of mechanical games like football, cricket and other cause they were too limited and congested. That these are the rules, this is right form, this is wrong  that i felt bored very fastly. 

 i liked games which has more adventure,  emotions involved, and something new.

So in outdoor games there was only Hide and seek . There was an abandoned IAS house building so it was really fun to play hide and seek there and ylwe never even got chance to fully explore all permutations. Jumping over the walls, hiding inside the buildig, be cautious and running from monkeys

(Maybe no need to tell upper lore to not  close friends who will tolerate even boring talks, lower one is necessary)

Games i used to play with arpit 

Pretend play we will take role of one of our favourite characters from movies, games and then we will mix story, characters and everything of all of them .

Fighting each other and enemy with sticks.

If arpit dies, then i will forcefeed him Tulsi ke paate jise hm jadibuti khte thee ek dusre ko revive marne ke liye.

To defeat one of the boss, we made poster a giant enemy and we were throwing stones, but obviously for us we were using some special attack, laser beam

.

.

We discovered throwing stones on poster from pretend play. 

And i didn't even know when this thing turned into us trying to tear the poster down.

.

(Omit above part if female there cause it will make you less masculine, more childish pretend play, but maybe if enough connection you can use it) to play p

Throwing stones together on poster. It was an activity we just recently picked up. It originated from a game.

'it was really fun and we were excited to tear the whole poster down '

We were only few minutes into the game suddenly something clicked

I threw a stone , it pierced the poster alright

I had an moment of epiphanhy, a sudden realization, 

Clicking (realising and conecting)

It suddenly dawned own me the stones we are throwing can hit a car. We were only small 1st class kid and i told you how this originated none of us thought so far ahead that we can damage car.

First thing that arose in me was fear!

You know if you are wandering in house alone at night in dark  then suddenly if thought of ghost enter you, then you start spreading ghost everywhere.

Don't look outside from window a ghost can be peaking in or don't look into the window a ghost might be there.

So same type of thing happened to me!

I thought we have been thrown stones for so longthere are chances we have hit 2-3 cars. Then one core fear was bugging me

What if i just realized because i hit a car and heard it unconsiouly. I wasn't paying attention? See i was fully engaged in talking throwing and being in flow i wasn't keenly paying attention to sound, it's highway so there is lot of noice and vehicle that comes and goes.

Then question arose in me and i had gut feeling i knew the answer to.

'why this realization now?'

We were in full flow state, laughing,  and was really really enjoying it. 

Why this realization now?

So i dismmissed the feeling that false alarm!

But there was a gut feeling in me that was screaming danger danger !

 but i felt little scared so i turned to my friends and asked ``Did you hear that  sound of stone hitting car?" The two of them denied.

I had gut feeling 'mera pathar car pr lga hai isliye so maybe hearing sound?'

But hearing sound of rocks should be very very difficult because let me tell you about terrain there was good distance between us and the wall first and foremost. On the otherside there were lot of bushes, trees , wide nala so you can't hear the sound of patthar after it pierced the poster and land on other side of road, also the size of rock us 1st class kids can lift is so small. Muthi hi kitni bdi hoti hain.

I thought maybe i was imagining things because

I just had realisation that stones acm hit a car butt…. There was this constant dear agitation and 

I was freaking out

I used to be super coward (darpok) insaan.

I knew the two of them won't be like i am their friend so they will protect my secret and just stay silent

"ayush SAYAD tumhare pathar kisi gadi pr laga hai mujhe aawaj aayi"

Even though i was really small at that time, i held this strong sense of morals. 

Normally children are mischievous and don't have stronge values but As a child i had very rigid and strong sense of values and morals. I never lied. I will choose to be silent or shoo away the topic but i never lied.

What is right, what is wrong, strong & rigid moral values i always identify myself with that image (my self image) so i broke a rule of that and i felt really guilty but what i told was half-lie 

Mene usse SAYAD word his use Kiya aur SAYAD hi pathar lga hain.

Pr khud ko yee bhi pata tha ki main khali khud ko paagal bana aa rha hun. So i suprresed down my guilt. 

I considered his my bestfriend.

I think somewhere intutively i knew that akshat bhiya is bhiya and ayush is my age so putting and pushing around a weak person is more easier.

I immediately felt guilty and though why did I say this. 

You know in childhood it wasn't like i was chalak kid, everyone called me masuum bcha hai.

I had strong sense of righteousness and held friendship in high value .
I remember preahcing to AYUSH WHY SHOULD WE BE GRATEFUKL TO PARENTS

How can I betray me own value.

Maybe fear revelaed my true nature to myself.

(Action happened first then consequences and explanation of action comes)

It has happened many time where something happened and i expected these are my friends they willnt sell me off to my parents but I WAS ALWAYS BETRAYED.

Earlier i used to think i was oblivious/innocent and because of that .

I now realize that real reason was i used to see everything, the whole world through  poetic lens, mother,father, friends.

I remeber when i was in ukg-1st class, i was giving sermon to my bestfriend about 'Why i feel we should be grateful to our parents' it felt so nice teaching it to my friend. It also gave me an immense sense of moral superiority.

(i was overflowing with altruism as child.)

I used to think i was innocent and these people took advantage of it . 

But reality was that i just turned world into sort of poetry and now since its imagenary and false and really world is more bland .

I messed things up.

Now he too got scared and our disperesed

bhiya went to his home. I couldn't go home because my mom used to force me to go outside. and play otherwise i will spend all of the time inside my house and i was not allowed to get inside the house after 7:30 sayad? 

. Ayush and I escaped back to gully. 

I felt really bad for lying to person i call my bestfriend

In childhood i always always moral uptight. You shouldn't lie, respect parents, help and think others, gali dena bura hota hai, etc etc. I strongly believed and was serious in adhering those principles so  for betraying my principles out of cowardice but nothing happened for 25-30 min we lost ourselves in play

Nothing happened for few minutes we continued to play but then an uncle/bhiya came and asked to show hands. I had scrubbed my hands in clothes earlier  so my hands were clean.

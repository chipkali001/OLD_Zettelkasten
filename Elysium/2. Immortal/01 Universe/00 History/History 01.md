Tribesmen how find water is first dig hole fill salt in it. Wait for babboon to come however when he puts hand in hole. His hands get stuck and can't pull oute first full. Man comes helps him and gives him as much salt as he wants to eat.
Baboon gets thirsty, man fallow baboon and then both drink as much salt as they want

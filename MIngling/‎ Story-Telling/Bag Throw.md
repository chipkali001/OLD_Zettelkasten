First talk of Physical charactertic of pass - didn't fit in pocket - you have to hang it on neck - Mein isse nhi use kr rha ~~latka ke ja rha~~ (INTERNAL MOCKERY)
**Apparently somya's satyagrah has ended (laugh earn) , she told me to take the pass - mujhe pass ki jarrurat nhi uski**
Now it's ironic what happened next (SHOW AS if you were GOING TO LOOSE - but smoothly exit that out)
I went only few steps & guess who came out?
**Sports Teacher** - he was walking inside the corridor 
PROBLEM WASN'T JUST ME NOT HAVING PASS?
When he will ask me - which teacher- can't lie - sports teacher aware which teacher class TO CATCH BUNKING KIDS - they'll ask name of teacher 
I DID ONLY THING I COULD
Hamari aankehin mli
I SMILED  said GOOD MORNING SIR 
before he could say anything - i hurried my pace - duck - touched his feet.
Ek last baar hlka phir see bow aur then i
KEPT WALKING 


Somya ask - BAG?
I said i went there to drink water --> A Section ka games period hain. 
AND tumhara satyagrah khatam hogya hain to jao (I didn't said it likt hat - i am telling you the essence)



> [!Attention] MAKE IT LOOK SMOOTH-ELEGANT.  Make them expect you are going to get beaten - SMILE ISN'T TO CHARM - but in SUBMISSION


Tell encounter

TELL AGE
I dismissed 
Now sitting down
	Problem - I wasn't sure if she will really tell - ~~my mind image of her wasn't Chalu (needn't tell) ~~
	BUT i have seen her **narrating same situation REFRAMING** that teachers never hit her.
	LIKE STORY IS LONG  but (I used to show paper to kids)
	SO IN CASE
	 (**VERSION 2(non boi tell, non luv imply)(don't tell age)** - Now school exam, class mein cheaitlng ka flow was. My best-friend behind me, he will see and spread to whole class. behind row & to next column.
	 NOW MATHS PAPER  - in maths you can't orally tell.
	 Somya other row ALL THE WAY BACK - her paper was going bad.
	 When she was asking me - i was like WHAT DO  YOU EXPECT? 
	 NOW NOW when we were approaching end - Sir darwaze pee htee (GYE nhi, whi hain. She came from all the way back to my seat, turned my paper 180* STARTED TO WRITE - i am at first seat, sir door pr,
	IT TOOK ME FEW SECONDS for me to ADJUST 
	Her writting speed was slow so si just **SNATCHED(CHIIN LIYA)** her sheet
	It must have taken 1-2min - i completled all 5marks questions. 
	Worst person could have noticed - which i knew when i was INLINE for Chutti
	Maths teacher came - called me & her out - PEN INK same at last of paper
	MAM also came at that time. She actually had waited for time - when hmara maths ka period hain - BOLNE ke liye

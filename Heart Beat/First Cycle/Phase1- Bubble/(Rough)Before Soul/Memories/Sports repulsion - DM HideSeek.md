I began to develop a kind of repulsion from too mechanical games that were too congested by rules like cricket, football. Cause they are exciting nad nice for few initial games but after few time you know kind of how game will play out, patterns and it feels kind of boring, there is nothing to be excited about once you have played the amount of players arrangement in two teams that could be.

That’s why i was utterly bored by the, but i loved hide and seek.

Two spots i loved and played hide and seek for longest time was temple and

In our gully, there was abandoned DM house, IAS officer ko jo ghar milta hai.

In mandir, hm bhagwan ki murti ki pich chupna, ya gol gol ghumna bich wali kaali ma ke mandir ke around, also we used to hide up in roof, by using the chabutra and the wall (like you see spiderman).

Aur DM house was just cazy. IT was big house, there was even swimming pool (not maintained) but it was big, also a part of DM HOUSE was our colony’s club where there were parties of factories, so that part was open so we used to hide inside the building, jump over the walls, there were lot of monkeys too so we have to be cautious of them, there was part of house which wasnt unlocked there were wall with shards of glass on top so we can’t just do GTA wall climb (JUMP, hang on wall, lift yourself up and put one leg on top of wall then other one) you can’t normally jump over them but there was oe time wheer me and my 2-3 friends were locked in the balcony of house and the garden so first gathered bricks by uprooting the bricks that were arranged in the garden you must know in the slant direction, so we can get up to suitable height from where which we can get on top of wall then climb outside and it was something with endless possibility, we can create groups communicate with each other to locate where is dan, scream out code words to indicate where is the danner and it was really really fun.

But only problem with hide and seek there was the DM house was very big so we required large number rof kids gang to play it also if the chokidar uncle will see us climbing the top of walls so we will alsh out at us, so someone has to be on lookout to see if guard uncle wasn’t paying attention here and one by one we will climb the wall.

IT was always crazy and only one game will take so long to finish but it was amazing.

Now now there was my 2nd best favourite game pretend play

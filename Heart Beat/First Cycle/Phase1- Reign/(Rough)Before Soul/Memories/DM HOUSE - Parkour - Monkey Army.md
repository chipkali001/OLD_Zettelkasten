# DM HOUSE - Parkour - Monkey Army

There was an DM house in our colony, There was even a swimming pool which was always filled  with ashes that our factor excrtes which was abandoned because the old DM got a bigger home somewhere else so while playing hide and seek 

During that we used to climb up the walls using support of water pipes bcoz the gates were closed (we also have to make sure guards havent noticed us trespassing otherwise they woud have khaaded us out. It happed many times actually). Then from that wall to the more higher wall which was the wall separating us from main building. We had to use our whole body to climb the higher wall. I alway feared directly jumping from the higher wall becoz it was scary to me. then from that high place we take a left turn and from that to down close to where there was the abandoned chokidar place 

One time monkey’s large gang started coming when I was still climbing the wall with fear.

My friends urged me to jump quickly because they cant jump until I jump s they pushed me a little and i landed don my two hands and legs. The vibration travelled in my whole body. and my  other friends jumped two, hit inside the guard post and we were fighting who will get to stay in the corner and who will get to stay near the door becoz monkey might come from near the door and I was also scared of lizard which may be lurking in the coroner.

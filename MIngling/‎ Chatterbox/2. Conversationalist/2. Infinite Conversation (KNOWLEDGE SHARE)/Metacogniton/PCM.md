#Metacogniton
First asking question
If you just look then chance learning happens low
You have to ask question to adjust **aperture** so you see it stand out in 3d and stand against that noisy background

Physics
Learn concept, 

question helps to calibrate understanding and know holes in understanding,

Maths - patterns repeats, aim to look at in what situation what method best - **must must must to have solution next to you as you solve**.
There is an algorithm to almost all stuff in chapter. 
And there are very limited algorithm

**Physics** - similar to maths algorithm, but lil harder and complex.
**Must to know all derivations but not in boards way. Just write formulae then just tell.where parts were manufactured**
I think when we add new concept and add it to our vocabulary, it's kind of in mushy form. 
Questions in physics are tool to use to calibrate that interconnected mushiness and enforce rigidity.
**try not to look at questions itself but the facet that it's making you look at. Questions that arises internally.**

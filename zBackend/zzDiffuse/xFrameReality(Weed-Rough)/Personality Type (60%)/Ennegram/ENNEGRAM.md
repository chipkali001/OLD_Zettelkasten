# The Discernment of Spirits
USE & CONSIDER THEM TYPE OF ENERGY INSTEAD OF JUST BEING RIGID. CONSIDER IT THEIR EMOTIONAL STATE
—
COMPULSIONS/SHOCKWAVES
3,6,9 are most masked/distant from themselves.
9 Constant shock-wave of body (8,9,1)
6 Constant shock-wave of Head (5,6,7)
3 Constant shock-wave of Heart - trapped in feeling world (2,3,4)

1, 4, 7 (Conflicted)
2, 5, 8 (Obvious & easy to spot)

Only 1’s & 3’s are ones to push themselves to be all king, warrior, magician, lovers

If  are conflated/dont know what your energy is you’re 6 or 9
6 want reassurance from authority they are 6.
*Your ennegram may change. women identify thmeselves as two’s after after having multiple babies* 
USE OF ENNEGRAM to catch your false self & become more godly - to recognise your patterns - thats why it may be shameful to hear - weep over your sin - so you can let go of attachment

Biggest space in eneagram is between head & heart cuz hardest bridge to gap yet most transcended/creative/holistic

Opposites attract. like 2s&5s - oh she so caring lovey-dovey, oh he so masculine detacged. 2s natural givers, 5s natural taker

# Arrow System - SOUL child theory
soul child theory - you had a soul personality but something traumatising impeded that in early childhood & you beame your current enneagram but time to time when you are in your best state you will go back to being *soul child*  & take **best aspects** of that enneagram.
EACH HEALTHY ENNEGRAM LOOK LIKE THEIR **SOUL CHILD** so you may wrongly categories people
1s→7s - once they were super-happy & non-rigid (ennegram-7) now they follow rules & punctual to recreate that happy world.
2s→4s - they get chance to lean back into their individuality - live for self & do some creative, mythical, artistic (ennegram-4)
3s→6s - they get back to religious nature & following tradition & comfort & stop-competing (ennegram-6) - they are achieving things to recreate the perfect world.
4s→1s - they go back to  (ennegram-1)  that principles, the disciplines, ideals
5s→8s - (ennegram-8)- contact with reality again & fight - doing action, helping poor in concrete way - in childhood couldnt do the opposition so he theorize/intellectualized the whole thing to get semblance of control
6s→9s they get laidback nature
7s→5s - read book/research intellectual work & not be on happy-dumb island cuz 7s & 3s hate to read
8s→2s- stop opposing & become kind/loving/nurture/gentle Ex-mother Terresa
9s→3s - they gain focus - become super efficient

THEY gain the WORST ASPECT

#### WHEN THE GUT CENTER DOMINATES

For Enneagram Types [Eight](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-8-challenger), [Nine](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-9-peacemaker) and One, the dominant center is the gut. These types are driven by the need for independence, both from other people and from the restrictive conditions of their environment. If you know someone who reacted very strongly against the recent lockdown and social distancing measures, for example, the chances are they were an autonomy-seeking 8, 9 or 1!

For these types, responses are extremely visceral. A strong gut feeling or intuition informs their decision-making, and they react almost immediately to their surroundings without ever really pausing to think about whether their impulses are meaningful, or how their reactions might affect others. 

More than anything, these types want to live with autonomy and self-determination in a clear-cut world of good and bad, right and wrong, where they can defend their territory and be grounded in the world. If they feel bad, they usually blame themselves. When their freedoms are restricted, they get angry, or sometimes they'll act with resentment or impatience at their own powerlessness. 

When gut types start to get angry or impatient for no obvious reason, it’s a sure sign they’re out of balance. The gut has much to say when it feels under threat, but it needs support from the head and heart centers to even things out. Take a deep breath and pause before you react, gut types. Talking to someone can calm you down and help you see other sides of the situation. And don't forget to engage your logic. This can be especially beneficial for helping you find security in what you do have, rather than kicking back against what you don’t have. 

#### WHEN THE HEART CENTER DOMINATES

For Enneagram Types [Two](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-2-giver), [Three](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-3-achiever) and Four, feelings are of central importance. People in this group are chiefly guided by the emotional qualities that sustain relationships with others — things like recognition, social inclusion and emotional support. Whereas gut types focus on their inner sense of control, heart types direct the focus outwards. How am I perceived by others? Do people like me? What can I do to develop these relationships?

Above all, heart types want others to pay attention to them. They want to be noticed. Yes, they are emotionally intelligent and can both access their own feelings and adapt well to the moods and feelings of others. But the driver is less about supporting others in a truly altruistic way, and more about deriving a sense of self-worth from the appreciation they receive for their efforts. If their needs for recognition are not met, then a heart-type will react with panic, longing, sadness and, above all, shame. They feel flawed and undeserving if others are not actively appreciating their contributions. 

When heart types feel their self-esteem plummeting, then it’s a sure sign that their center of intelligence is out of balance. Seek balance by connecting with your own emotions, instead of looking for external approval. What is your gut telling you to do in this situation? Can your head center help you see that enough is enough?

#### WHEN THE HEAD CENTER DOMINATES

For Enneagram Types [Five](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-5-investigator), [Six](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-6-skeptic) and [Seven](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-7-enthusiast), the head dominates. This does not mean that these types are smarter than the others. Rather, our head center is the place where the desire for safety, competence and predictability are the primary instincts. 

The focus of the head types is analysis. For this group, the world is primarily perceived through a series of factual concepts. The goal is to gain security through the mental processes of planning, thinking and foresight. Head types trust these processes as the best way to help them gain control over potentially painful or dangerous situations.

What you’ll notice with head types is they navigate a new situation by first distancing themselves from it. Unlike gut types who act immediately, head types will not leap until they have looked and planned the situation very, very carefully. If you know someone who routinely overthinks things, they likely will belong to the head triad. 

When safety, reliability and predictability are in short supply, head types will react with fear, caution, mistrust and doubt. They can often be paralyzed by fear, risking inaction and complete detachment from their heart and gut if their safety is compromised. 

This is why, for head types, connection to the Instinctual and Feeling triads is essential for their well-being. Analyzing your experiences from a distance is not bad, but analysis in and of itself, without action, will not get you anywhere. Try talking to a heart-centered friend to get outside your head and inside your feelings. Give yourself permission to trust, and to act from, the gut. Without balance, you may find yourself stuck in a hole of observing your life, instead of fully living it.

Type 1: Reformer. Wants to be looked at as good in the eyes of others. Would rather be on the side of good than evil. Will dutiful perform their responsibilities. They also are classical idealists. Of course not everything can go perfectly all the time and they need to learn to let go sometimes. A good example from current American politics is Robert Mueller.

Type 2: Helper. They love to take care of others but this includes being in everyone’s business. For them to know how to help you best, they need to know everything about you and your connection to others. Constantly steeped in a web of social interaction. A good example is Dolly Parton.

Type 3. Achiever. They wanna be the best at everything they do. Not necessarily craving power but recognition. They strive through hard times because they are more prone to optimism. These are the people in High School that write 10 pages instead of 5 for a final paper. This allows them to distinguish themselves from the rest. Can devolve into other people calling them people pleasers. A good example is Oprah Winfrey.

Type 4. Individualistic. These are one of the most withdrawn Types if not the most. Their expression is found in their ingenuity and creativity. They experience the world in a very visceral way that most people do not. When they decide to express themselves it is usually in an explosion of creative genius. A good example Edgar Allen Poe.

Type 5. Investigator. This Type is representative of knowledge in its most crude form. They want to build a wall of knowledge around them as to protect themselves from the world. If they have an abundance of learning, they can control their own destiny. They’ve figured that untrue information leads to inaccurate assessment of problems and solutions. This makes them withdrawn and constantly trying to discern truth. A good example is Richard Dawkins.

Type 6. Loyalist. They are committed to be by the side of those they consider to be their friends. They wish to champion the causes of themselves and others. Type 6 can be very testing of others to make sure these people are actually loyal. If they find that there is no reciprocation they start becoming stressed. When they discover this they may instead become sneaky and competitive. A good example is Sigmund Freud.

Type 7. Enthusiast. They exude life and energy wherever they go. Because of an overactive mind, they constantly learn new things. But because they quickly become bored, they need to be constantly on the move. Their strengths lay in their spontaneity. This allows them to improvise at will. If a Type 7 is talking to you, better know that they are quickly locking in on “what you are all about.” They are chastised because of unreliability and some may even go as far as to call them disloyal. A good example is Richard Feynman.

Type 8. Challenger. This Type sees life as a constant struggle between the self and the outside. Why does the outside world keep on changing, they ask themeselves. There becomes a need to control ones own circumstances by any means possible. They see opportunity to cause havoc and reshape the world in their own liking. This allows them to confront dangerous events with the hope of conquering it and taming it. People may see this Type as too bossy or serious. A good example is Donald Trump.

Type 9. Peacemaker. This is the Type that goes with the flow. They will often capitulate to the needs of others. Most amount of avoidance is found in this Type. They do not really accept their own desires to be of too much importance. Even though they are pretty realistic, they do not treat themselves as though they had a body. Their individuality is kind of lost on themselves. They will tend to merge with those around them taking on different forms as they maneuver the world. Because sometimes they wish not to participate in showing their core, they can be distrusted by many. A good example is Ronald Reagan.

1s: Kind of anal, needs to get off their high horse. Thinks they’re a better person than you. Probably is. That sucks.

2: The nicest person you’ll ever meet. Likes that about themselves. Honestly, I’ve only met nice 2s but it’s probably because thinking of themselves as un-nice would totally mess up their self-esteem so they can’t show their true colours!

3: Hyper competitive narcissists who are actually very good at their work. Delusions of grandeur, want to be famous and successful. Will try to win at everything. Gets mad when they lose at monopoly.

4: Sensitive, emotional, but also quite self-centred. Creative and artistic! Dramatic but, like, unironically. Seem depressed. Massive downers but at least they have style.

5: Smart but terrible at socialising. Reads non-fiction and the news for leisure. Almost like it’s fun. Will actually try to start conversations with factoids it’s sort of endearing but a bit cringe. Out of touch with reality but it’s quite endearing.

6: Anxiety personified. It stresses me out.

7: You know how class clowns exist? Maybe not even the funny one, but the one that clowns around and breaks test tubes and does the most risky things for fun? Yes, he was a 7.

8: Scary, aggressive, angry, domineering. Probably secretly a cannibal. Edgy, but, like, unironically. Either leads all the time or seems to radiate dominance and animosity. Makes me uncomfortable.

9: Peaceful and lazy vibe. Not a lot of thrill seeking, quite therapeutic. Fun to bully. Quite unassuming, won’t fight back, but also isn’t that nice? Just not really a presence tbh.

# PERFECT PRACTICE OF ATLEAST 10 first impression stories
Once you have time then rewrite the stroy by creating multiple routes 
Route to tell a single human 
Route to tell a group of friend 
Route on basis if how close i am(How much vulnerability will be okay) ( how much info dumps i should give to uplift image they have of me) with person who i am narrating story to.

First practice and collect lot of observations, what’s differences you feels in body when narrating incidents witth different tones. Once done with this, go to youtube and watch/analyze/compare-yourself standup-comedy storytelling videos

Say when it’s fun & ready-to-laugh mood.

Remebe the incident with vedant bhiya where when you were explaining the story you skipped out on lot of dialogue and stuff and just shortened everything. So practice in front of camera. Speaking without revison. Write down the order/bullet points which you will use to guide your story telling

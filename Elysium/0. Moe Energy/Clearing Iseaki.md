Two princesss wik cant do anything against  
  
  
“I haven’t met him for a week here, you know?!” (Noel)  
“I see. You’ve got it tough, huh. I pity you.” (Furiae)  
“And yet, he is meeting you?!” (Noel)  
“Hey, don’t grab my hand! That hurts.” (Furiae)  
“Ryosuke-san! Is this woman that good?!” (Noel)  
Aah, Princess Noel is losing it.  
“Say that to the person himself.” (Furiae)  
“…I can’t.” (Noel)  
“Ha! Wearing the mask of a saint must be rough.” (Furiae)  
“I don’t want to hear that from a person that Charms people  
  
Cajolery  
  
I asked as if grasping at straws.  
  
A handsome face as if sculpted, and a cold expression as if everything in the world is  
boring.  
  
(I am just lending it to you, okay...?) (Makoto)  
(......Now then, I am tired. Gonna take a nap.) (Astaroth)  
(O-Oi!) (Makoto)  
He cut off the Thought Transmission.  
I hope he is not trying to pocket it for himself.  
But I am glad Astaroth is okay.  
It seems like the memento of Cain was of use.  
  
“Sorry for the wait... Is this attire alright?” (Noel)  
“Good morning, Noel-sama. I think it is fine.” (Makoto)  
Queen Noel didn’t come in her usual dress, but in a military uniform that you would see in the battlefield.  
It is probably because she doesn’t have adventurer clothes.I can tell at a glance that there’s several defense spells enchanted on that military uniform.  
With this, it should be safer than adventurer clothes.  
“Then, let’s go.” (Makoto)  
I stretch out my right arm.  
I thought that suddenly holding the hand of a queen was rude, but I was too slow to reach that thought.  
“O-Okay.” (Noel)  
Queen Noel grabs my hand nervously.  
  
“Heya there, Noah-kun. You are making quite the complicated expression there. That’s a waste of your cute face.”  
  
I subdue my anger.  
  
Furiae-san puckered her lips as if saying ‘I understand what you say, but I don’t agree with it’.  
  
By the way, within this vast venue where thousands of people have gathered for the ceremony (wedding), our table is right in front of the lectern.And so, we can see Sakurai-kun and Queen Noel well.“It is so boring, watching someone else’s wedding.” (Furiae)  
  
“I... see... My apologies. Normally, I should be interjecting, but there isn’t much a princess of a small country can do...”(Sofia)  
  
As for me, I am half in doubt.  
  
“......I see.” (Noah)  
Noah-sama smiled slightly sadly.  
But that was only for an instant.  
“Oh well, can’t be helped! Then, let’s think of a real way.” (Noah)  
By the next instant, she was back to the usual bright Noah-sama.  
She is acting as if she doesn’t mind that I rejected her request.  
But for me, it looks as if she is pushing herself here.I could feel that I have saddened her.  
What should I... say...?  
  
“I am impressed you managed to hold your ground there! Well  
  
See ya, Devil King.” (Makoto)“Wa...?!” (Barbatos)There’s already the dagger of Noah-sama stabbed in the chest of Barbatos.“Since... when...?” (Barbatos)“I stoppedyour time and stabbed you.” (Makoto)I bluntly told him the truth.“!”The Devil King couldn’t say anything.The pierced body of the Demon Lord crumbled into sand and disappeared.“Fuuh...”(Makoto)I sighed.It is one of the Demon Lords I have had a connection with since 1,000 years ago.I have finally managed to defeat him.Queen Noel had her mouth wide open and it eventually changed into her staring at me with half-closed eyes.  
“Noel-san?” (Makoto)“...You are way too outrageous. No, I knew that from the moment of the Deep Sea Temple though.” (Noel)“Was that battle style bad?” (Makoto)“You did that despite having been scolded by the Destiny Goddess-sama?” (Noel)She sighed, baffled.  
  
“Makoto-san... please hear me out.” (Anna)Anna had closed onto me to a distance that her breath could reach me.I could feel something abnormal from that face at her wit’s end.“What’s the matter, Anna-san?” (Makoto)My most important mission is Hero Abel.I wasn’t worried because we were training safely in the Sun Temple, but maybe there was an actual problem occurring?I held my necklace lightly.(...Ira-sama, can you hear me?) (Makoto)(I can. It looks like a problem has happened with Hero Abel.) (Ira)(I will listen to the problem. Please let me consult with you.) (Makoto)(Leave it to me.) (Ira)As expected of a Goddess.So reliable.“You won’t be coming back for a while after going to the Deep Sea Temple, right?” (Anna)Anna-san speaks.  
“I will be returning every now and then. It seems like Momo can function better by drinking my blood after all.” (Makoto)“...For the sake of Momo-chan?” (Anna)“?”What does she mean by that?“Are you... not worried about me?” (Anna)“Uhm...”(Makoto)“You will be leaving this place while you are in the Deep Sea Temple. Are you not going to worry about me...?” (Anna)“O-Of course, Abel-san as well.” (Makoto)“Anna.”“I will also worry about Anna-san too.” (Makoto)“Then, please bring me with you!” (Anna)“T-That’s... I can’t.” (Makoto)  
  
[Will you drink the fruit juice laced with aphrodisiac?]  
  
  
“Hero Makoto…?” (Sofia)  
Princess Sofia looked at me uneasy.  
I resolved myself and chugged down the contents of the glass.  
“I-In one go?!” (Sofia)  
Princess Sofia opened her eyes wide, knowing that I am not strong with alcohol.  
I felt a bit light-headed most likely because I got drunk, but I didn’t mind it and used Clear Mind.  
“Sofia.” (Makoto)  
I unconsciously called her name.  
“Y-Yes…” (Sofia)  
The blushing Princess Sofia looked extremely cute.  
Is it the effect of the aphrodisiac?  
But Princess Sofia is beautiful, so this might just be the usual.  
By the time I noticed, I was kissing her.  
And then, just when I placed a hand on her dress and was about to take it off, I remembered what happened in the morning.  
I looked at the door, it was unlocked.  
That’s not good.  
(Water Magic: [Eternal Freeze].) (Makoto)  
I froze the whole door.  
With this, it will be impossible to enter that door.  
At this rate, it won’t be frozen for one night but several years, so I should undo the spell later.  
“Makoto…” (Sofia)  
Princess Sofia looks at me with a feverish gaze.  
My head got dizzy at her cuteness again.  
I push Princess Sofia down onto the bed.  
—No one interrupted that night.  
  
  
  
  
“Yes, be careful. But please let me pray for the victory of everyone before you depart.” (Esther)Esther-san says this as she linked both hands and lowered her head lightly.“Destiny Magic: [Blessing of the Goddess].” (Esther)A beautiful light covers the body of Esther-san.She then approaches Anna-san and kisses the back of her hand.The place she kissed let out a faint light.“This is...?” (Anna)Esther-san smiles when Anna-san asks this.“It is Destiny Magic that confers good luck. With this, the arrows and long distance spells of enemies won’t hit you.” (Esther)Ooh!That would help out a lot.A buff spell of the Oracle-sama, huh.I waited in excitement, but she went to Momo and Johnny-san, and Iwas ignored.E-Eh...?“Uhm... Esther-san?” (Makoto)  
“Fufufu, Makoto-sama has the Divinity of Ira-sama. My spell doesn’t even begin to compare to that. Rather, it would get in the way.” (Esther)Eeeh~, I also wanted the buff of the Destiny Oracle...(Listen here! You have the world’s best luck in you!) (Ira)I hear the loud voice of Ira-sama.Really...?I have been having nothing but hardships since coming here though.“Well, there’s no deep meaning to it, but if it is a kiss to wish you luck in battle, I can give as many as you want...”(Esther)Esther-san said this with a smile as she approached me.Hm?Why are you wrapping your arms around my head instead of taking my hand?“Master! Let’s depart at once!” (Momo)“Thank you very much for the spell of good luck, Esther-san! Let’s go, Makoto-san!” (Anna)The Great Sage-sama and the Light Hero-san were pulling the collar of my clothes with incredible strength.  
  
  
  
  
“I was fine though.” (Makoto)“That’s because you are weird.” (Ira)“That’s rude.” (Makoto)“Who is the rude one. The WhiteDragon-chan said it before, right? You act way too familiar with a Goddess. What are you doing looking down on me? Kneel.” (Ira)Ira-sama pressed my head down.She may be a small and weak girl, but she was a good match against me who has low stats.“I don’t wanna! I only kneel to one person!” (Makoto)“Heeh, is that so? Then, I will have the Apostle of that woman Noah yield.” (Ira)“What a terrible personality!” (Makoto)“Fufufu, my merciful heart has perished with those words! I will have you lick my boots.” (Ira)A massive sadist!A super sadistic Goddess!“I don’t wanna! The only one who can make me lick her boots is Noah-sama!” (Makoto)  
“Are you a pervert...?At any rate, you are weak.” (Ira)“Stop!” (Makoto)I tried to struggle, but it was fruitless, andthe small Oracle straddled me.My physical strength is seriously low.“Now, I have caught you. Obey me.” (Ira)I am under Ira-sama now.“Kuh, kill me!” (Makoto)“Fufufu, give in, Takatsuki Makoto...”(Ira)At that moment when we were having that silly exchange...“Makoto-san?”“Master... What are you doing?”I hear the voices of other people in the place where there’s supposed to be only me and Ira-sama.Anna-san and Momo.““““......””””The roaring sound of the waterfall resonates.“T-This is a misunderstanding...”(Makoto)“That’s not it...”(Ira)Right at the moment when Ira-sama and I said this at the same time...“Makoto-san, you idiooooot!!” (Anna)“Stupid Masteeeeer!!!” (Momo)  
Anna-san and Momo left running  
  
“If you were to become an enemy, Abel-san, Mel-san, and I won’t be able to fight. At the very least, I wouldn’t be able to. That’s why, be a support for this one, Momo. If there’s any who can’t fight anymore, I want you to carry them outside the battle area with Teleport.” (Makoto)“Uuuh... Got it.” (Momo)I nodded dejected.If he says it like that, I have no choice but to obey.“Fuh! I will take care of Our King, so there will be nothing for you to do, Shrimp.” (Dia)“What’s with you?! Talking all big here even though you were completely useless in the Deep Sea Temple!” (Momo)“T-That’s...!Everywhere aside from the Deep Sea Temple, I am super useful, I will have you know!” (Dia)“Hah?! Even I know that the Deep Sea Temple is the place that Master Makoto-sama wants to go the most!” (Momo)“S-Shut up, you shrimp. Talking all big with that seedy-looking body.” (Dia)“Wa?! Says the body of water! You can’t do anything with that!” (Momo)“Fufu, if I synchronize with Our King, we can do this and that...”(Dia)“Even I could do it if I were to try...”(Momo)“Alright, stop. Monsters have appeared, you two.” (Makoto)Master Makoto-sama covered the mouth of both me and Dia who were arguing.  
I hurriedly direct my gaze to the front.

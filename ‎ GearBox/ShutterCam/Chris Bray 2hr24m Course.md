#CPhotography 
Aperture HOW MUCH OPEN controls DOF
Shallow/Small DOF for Person Photo, Blurry background 3D look
Large DOF for landscape
**Small DoF = Small F# = Large Aperture**
Do with your eyes - Put hand in front - To make hand stand out background blurry - widen eyes
**inution for f#** - more F, more objects - LESS F, less object/part focus like with hand blur

LargeF=SmallerShutter=MoreTimeForExposure=BLUR


**EYES DOES** that role of adjusting how much Aperture open by squinting

Normal mirror didn’t allow light to pass through shutter
But then mirror up, shutter receives
light and impressions gets ~~collected which overlay on each other~~ smeared over each other.

AF=autofocus
AF-S = Focus on one object and if you move camera around - that spot in screen where object was in will remain focus
AF-C / AI-SEVERO = Willl trail object, if you move camera will change focus point on screen to remian on object
MF=Manual Focus

Camera - shutter button
2 STAGE PRESS- 1st stage Allow camera to focus on shot
2nd stage- take shot
DON’T PRESS BUTTON TOO HARD- Shakes camera & don’t get enought time in 1st stage

Elbows In - Give an BASE STABLITY - locks moving

SET DIOPTER - So it’s easy to look at screen of camera

**FOUCS ON EYES**

# COMPOSITON
1. Make sure horizon is horizontal and doesn’t look slanted.
19:20
Horizon - bottom 3rd
Cloud - top 3rd
Bird in middle thrird
2. 
20:20
Don’t get everyone people/**trees**/**grass** out of the way to take the shot.
INCLUDE THEM cuz they add DEPTH

3. 
Check background
22:15 - Lion bending with ground
Lion with Sky AMAZING CONTRAST
Bird AGAINST **SKY BLUE REFLECTION IN WATER**

4.
Simplify & Zoom into (NO NEED TO INCLUDE FULL WOMEN, FULL FISH)
Starfish in arms of women  & NOT WOMEN & STARFISH (distractory elements is she stealing starfish why is there bag in arm, there is tractor in background, she ain’t smiling)

5.
TAKE HORIZONTAL & VERTICAL PHOTOS OF EACH - Both images SAYS different thing 


# EXPOSURE (How much light goes through aperature SO HOW MUCH IT GLOWES)

OVER EXPOSURE
UNDER EXPOSURE

**EXPOSURE IRRUGALITY** *Due to too strong irregular lighting*
32:28 - Background Got too much exposure (OVER EPOSED) - But those people didn’t get that exposure (UNDEREXPOSED)
**That’s why midday is baddest time to take photo due to too strong light**


**P MODE**
Suggest same as AUTOMODE
but you can scroll clockwise or anticlockwise to get desired
Aperture-Shutter_Speed DUO 

**Mid Brightness Average** (Works most time)
40:40
Is **STILL Mid-Brightness** AVERAGE cuz half-White/Half-Black but **Person is black**

**Partial/SPOT Mettering** - partial-part/(Small-Point) GETS EXACT MID BIRGHTNESS

EXPOSURE COMPENSATION to go away from **Mid Brightness Average**


**LOT OF TIME** = too much sunlight CAN’T SEE SCREEN! You up brightness - NOW your photo won’t have same exposure that it may look on screen
**DON’T TRUST YOUR BACKSCREREN ALWAYS**


Don’t worry about SPIKE - it just says you have lot of black stuff or white stuff or slight white or slight black - like lot of chracol pieces may create spike in black, but that doesn’t mean your photo is underexposed
cuz there is less amount of light in white

**51:07 scrolling +1 +2 to BRING white color spike to the end so page comes out as white as it really is**

1h30sec 
⅓rd DoF Forward **FOCUS**
⅔rd DoF Behind **FOUCS**


**Don’t take TOO MUCH F# or TOO SMALL F# cuz it may take forever to take photo**
*CHECK FOR BLIPPING WARINING SIGNS*


# 
Showing movement ADD LIFES to photo. 
**CAMERA Must be MOTIONLESS - adjust on tripod or place**
Human subjects must bee too - otherwise blur


1:12:07 - SPIRAL STAR IMAGES
Northpole/SouthPole in center

If you life in north then north-star use for northpole direction to get spiral
but in south **use different techniques**

 # 
 Timer set BETTER than clicking button cuz it wobbles image a bit

# 
AS you are clicking photo/ capturing images smearing over each other.
1. Follow moving EAGE/CAR/HYNEA (Then blackgorund become blurry)
2. Zoom in/Zoom out (then you get an cool radial pic)

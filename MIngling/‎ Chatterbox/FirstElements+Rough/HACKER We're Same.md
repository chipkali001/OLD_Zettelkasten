# Instead of hopping in middle & say
### i relate with you
### i understand you
### Same Pinch

## Donâ€™t do that, instead just pretend that you donâ€™t know that you have something i.e. ==weâ€™re same== vibe. Just BE BLIND

## Instead ==at a later time== be like ABC happened and i feel like XYZ (***YOU CAN EVEN - do ==REPEATING WORDS-PHRASES== they said***). Make them be like OMG! i also! make them try to explain. you can from there be in leading position where you will be ASKING QUESTIONs & ==Vibing==

I want my kids to be like the opposite of my life as an adult
To have accomplished so much and to have worked hard towards their goal
Plus have had lots of fun on the way
Today is so beautiful outside and I hear people enjoying it
Maybe Iâ€™ll go out soon to sit there but idk bc I donâ€™t want to aggravate pain
I have so many things I want to do and this time I will do them
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:45 PM
You must be a dominate Fe user
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:45 PM
No
What is Fe in relation to this?

The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:46 PM
NO WAKE UP KITTY WAKE UP 
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:46 PM
I like the sound of people enjoying things but that doesnâ€™t make me an fe user lel
Itâ€™s just music to my ears
Comforting inspiring hope inducing
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:47 PM
When I hear people doing literally anything that's bad to me
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:47 PM
I donâ€™t doubt it
A lot of people feel that way
But to me itâ€™s a sign of things going right, it means that maybe I can be like that too
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:48 PM
Humans and all their judging despite knowing nothing. Disgusting
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:49 PM
Yes, people do be judgy
Very judgy indeed
But itâ€™s better to tune out of that
Your actions will eventually prove them wrong
If thatâ€™s ur concern
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:50 PM
Mine prove them right because I refuse to talk, look them in the eye, or give them positive emotion lol 
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:51 PM
You might be surprised but same, in real life I avoid people at all costs
Itâ€™s just that I wish I could be in a position where
I am able to
Socialise
So thatâ€™s the difference
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:52 PM
Have the right look and people will socialize with you
With no effort required on your part
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:53 PM
It would have to be the right look and feeling for me
Thatâ€™s the issue
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:53 PM
The feeling is often based on the look lol
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:54 PM
Well the feeling I mean is the feeling that this body is like Iâ€™m inside and itâ€™s just a shell Iâ€™m dragging around
I canâ€™t express myself in it
I know it sounds like bs but I have real grounds to feel this way
Dissociation
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:55 PM
What's your dominant function
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:56 PM
Ne or Fi
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:56 PM
Yeah I was about to say Fi next
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:56 PM
Itâ€™s def one of my top two
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:56 PM
My gf is Fi dominant
And I have no idea how we work
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:56 PM
Lmao
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:57 PM
Maybe the ruse will be up soon and we break up lol
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:57 PM
Well whichever is best for you both
But either way I hope itâ€™s not on bad terms 
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 4:58 PM
So basically then yeah I can understand you now though at least
Do you feel trapped between wanting to be social only to not be?
The Moon ðŸŽˆ â€” Today at 4:59 PM
Yes!
Emperor Dion -|-|- â€” Today at 5:00 PM
Yeah I KINDA get this, but in my case it's more so I like the idea of potentially being social but in all reality I rather not be and prefer that
The problem with high Fi is just finding true contentment

It could be the wrong people or just your nature

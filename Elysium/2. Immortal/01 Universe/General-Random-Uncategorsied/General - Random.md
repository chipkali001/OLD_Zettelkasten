Make things happen amazingly and don't explain.
In lack of explanation perceptions dcime reality.
You just need to deliver results with shockfactor but don't need to explain how.
Like in GOT that god-lvl-assassin that helps daughter by saying he'll kill 3 people's
....
We never got explaianatiom of how he did it in short time, hidden, smooth 
They just showed end result u can utilise this

Similar are schemes and tactics lot of time. Movement wasn't shown only end result.


I have heard, you're family is worried about future wife/heir/bloodline , shouldn't we solve probelm from its roots.
What do you say?

Death shock factor = wasted potential. 
That's why show normal plan of character continuing , everything working in sync, succeding according to plan then suddenly ðŸ’¥ boom 

Castle wall with illusion magic, cannons and largecroosboes in front u will think they fired at 45* north but it was launched towards you and it will be too late before u realise.
You don't realise where real position of Archer s until layer time passes

MC is forced to do impossible mission and for that he will have to do it.
Like invade xyz and then act as apc then get pqr

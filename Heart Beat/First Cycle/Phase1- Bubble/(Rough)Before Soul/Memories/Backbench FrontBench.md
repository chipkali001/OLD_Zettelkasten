Mei khi ka nhi tha nahi backbencher nahi frontbencher.
Picche baithunga to teacher aage bula lenge, ki tum picche my baithu,
piche baaith kr kuch khurafat hi kroge

Aagar aage bcche baithe hote thee to unhone pige bhej denge aur mujhe aage unki jagah bula lenge.

Ab me kya kru isme?

Unsbko mujhse itna pyaar tha ki itni duri bhi shi nhi jaati thi.

To meri koshis rhti thi ki itne Durr na baithu ki unhe baachani hone lge aur jayda as nahi kyuki phir me beechwn hojaunga

Ek balance

Sir/ Mam will call me and shubhankar from back seat and ask us t exchange seat with kids at first seat cuz we will create haala.

Aur phir bs aagee teacher ke words pr dhyan dena aur yee woo krne mei bhot nind aati hain,

Aur kuch moomfali kha ke timepass krna chaho to piche see bche sir sir krne lg jaynge.

Arpan and Vikas occupied and i couldnâ€™t make them budge from back
It was my weakness, i didnt have that strong sense of identity so i was in chameleon mode.

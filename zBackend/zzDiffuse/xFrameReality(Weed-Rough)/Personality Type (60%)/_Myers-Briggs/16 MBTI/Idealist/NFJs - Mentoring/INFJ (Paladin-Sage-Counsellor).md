ENFJ teach a person to fish so they can fish for rest of life THEN MOVE ON.
INFJ go around collecting disciplies, LOYAL DISCIPLES. new family, new movement. INFJ needs loyalty more for people to listen since ENFj have Se child wheras INFJ Se inferior, So ENFJ can command attention easily so they dont have to care much about loyalty.
ENFJ afraid of what they think, INFJ always know what they think.
ENFJ leave legacy like pyramid, building, bridge, company, NEVER FORGET ABOUT THEM
INFJ want movement like GANDHI.
ENFJ when see things getting out of hand ESTJ super-ego their Te activate force people to work and delivers whip  like  TASKMASTER (ESTJ super-ego)
Wheras INFJ when someone not loyal to them cut off people permanently, permanent sar, TO THE GUILLOTINE using ISTJ subconsious

**Si child or Si inferior WANT TO BE DIEHARD LOYAL so INFJ LOVE NPs thats why, uz they understand**

Se inferior explains why as kid i only played in center.

INFJ & INTJ have repressed Se so they are detached from sesnations & care about meaning of it. Thats why they may not start rying instantly hearing death of a loved one, sine their Ni is processing it.
Thats why you will find them having 1000-yard-stare/death-stare/looking-through-state they ARE LOOKING INTO IMPLIATIONS & MEANINGS.

Intimidation of death-stare can be used as an ATTRATIVE TOOL. Did you know? When you listen to someone tell your Intution to process all & get into depth of that human being. NOT JUDGING EYES. BUT PEERING INTO SOUL EYES.

Ni(Dom) like to think one thing at a time. (THATâ€™S WHY I GET ANGRY AT INTTERUPTION). where Ne tries to explain everyhting that cna happen. \
They dissociate from conversation in middle BEAUSE that one idea clinges in their mind & it stresses them (REPRESSED Se) and anything interuppting them is painful.
Makes them not wanna trust people because they may fear all these small-stupd details ome up and abolish all, since you are used to things blowing up on you.

Reprssed Se may result in them induldging  from short-term high stimulation activity like drugs, sexual-stimulation, food, overeating,.. 
Many struggle from overeating (Me too & Asura Psyche too)
Its easy to fall into temporary binging of food.
Way to control this is - 
1) Shower Se, give it fresh air, nature regular, exercise, sensory stimulus
2) Take note when you are falling into deprived Se
3) Use Ni to crush it by remembring 4 pilliar of self-intimay and YOU NEED TO SET STANDARDS for yourself to ahieve goals

**THEY SHOULD STUDY WITH A PARTNER & HAVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM**

MIRRORS - they are behaving badly so i will act the same

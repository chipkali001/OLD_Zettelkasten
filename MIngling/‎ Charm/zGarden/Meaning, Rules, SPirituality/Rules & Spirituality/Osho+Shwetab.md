Virtue-Equanimity   Vice-Envy

---

I was reading one memoir of a poet. His father had died, and the dead body was put in a coffin.

The poet, the son, was weeping, crying, and then suddenly he  kissed the  forehead of  his  father’s  dead  body  and  said,

“There, now that you are dead, I can do this. I always wanted to kiss you on your forehead, but while you were alive it was impossible. I was so afraid of you.”

You can kiss only a dead father – and even if the alive father allows you to kiss,

the kiss is going to be false; it cannot be spontaneous.

Just as you have the impulse to do something, stop.

Try it only when a real impulse is there.

Don't think about stopping, just stop.

Wait! When you have stopped:

no body movement, no breathing, no thought about inner-center.

A slight cooperation then you have deceived yourself. just stop.

You will forget the periphery and the center will come into your vision.

Inactivity is not to be practiced. Use it suddenly, when you are unaware

If you’re feeling sleepy, stop! But the feeling must be real; that’s the problem

If you are feeling thirsty, stop!

Let the thirst be there, but don’t move. Don’t inhale or exhale

You are feeling angry(real).

You are going to beat your child, or do something: Stop!

But do not stop with consideration.

Do not say, “Anger is bad, so I should stop” – no!

Don't Say, “This is not going to help the child, so I should stop.”

No mental consideration is  needed.

If you consider, then the energy has moved into consideration.

**Work  should be  considered as  play,  not  as  work.  Work  should  beconsidered as play, just a game. You should not be serious about it; youshould be just like children playing. It is meaningless, nothing is to beachieved;**

I am not saying that there is no soul, I am not saying that there is nothing which is deathless. No, I am not saying that. But as far as you are concerned, you are just the body with an idea that there is a soul which is deathless.

This is just in the mind, and this too you have collected because of the fear. Deathless is there; you can know it. Believing won’t do, only knowing can help. You can realize it, but just ideas are of no use unless they become a concrete experience.

But you are being taught continuously that you are two, body and mind, and that, really, you are the mind and you possess thebody.

The mind becomes the master and body becomes the slave, and you go on struggling against the body.

This creates a rift, a gap, and that gap isthe problem. All neurosis is born out of that gap; all anxiety is born out of that gap

Once we get identified with the thinking process, we think that we are centred in the head. If your legs are cut, you will not feel that you are cut. You will say,“My legs are cut.” But if your head is cut, you are cut. "You are murdered"

Mind  is  an  epiphenomenon –  a  process which is  necessary,useful, but secondary; a process which consists of words, not of realities.

Mind consists of words, of a verbal process, and then love itself becomes less significant than the word love.

Words become more meaningful, significant. They become primary, and we start living in words. And the more you live in words the more shallow you become, and you will go on  missing the reality which is not words. Reality is existence

**A flower is there – you say this is a beautiful flower. This saying is now no more in the present; it has become the past. When you come to grasp something in thinking, it has become the past. In the present you can be,but you cannot think. You can be with the flower, but you cannot think about it. Thinking needs time; living doesn’t need time**

**You will not be capable of love unless you move into meditation. Through love every moment becomes of value in itself.**

**Go beyond illusory relationships, and by and by just be loving.**

Love can become devotion only when this awareness is lost, [forgotten.It](http://forgotten.It) doesn’t mean that you have become unconscious, it only means that the process has become so silent that there is no noise around it. You are not unconscious of it, but you are not conscious of it either. It has become so natural like breathing.

It is there, but it does not create any disturbance inside; it has become so harmonious

**If this death had not come in between, then many incomplete things remain to be done.**

**He goes back, and looks at what was left behind.**

**Naturally in hundred years he started thousands of things**

**and thousands of things are left incomplete, nothing ever goes to completion.**

**Because one thing comes out of another, from the second thing the third and it always remains incomplete.**

**So thousands of things are left incomplete. He wants to stay a little longer and finish everything.**

Lie down as dead. Enraged in wrath, stay so.

Sometimes it happens in some nightmare – you cannot cry, you cannot move. Even when you become awake for a few moments you cannot do anything.

He closed his eyes and remained there, just waiting to die; he waited there just to die. By & by the body became stiff.  As if the body died.

It willn’t be a happy moment. It's not going to be so blissful while you’re feeling that you are dead.

Fear will take you, anger may come to mind, or frustration, sadness, sorrow, anguish....

If you feel enraged, stay so.

If you feel sad, stay so.

If you feel anxiety, stay so.

If you feel fear, stay so.

Whatsoever is in mind, the body is dead. You can’t do anything, so stay so.

If you can stay for a few minutes, suddenly you will feel that everything has changed.

Feel dead and do not allow emotions to move your body.

Let them be there, but you stay so  –  fixed, dead.

Whatsoever is there... Stay! no movement.

it is so difficult to be in such a deep love that you can feel as if the  other is not present. Only in a very deep love, in a very deep intimacy, is it possible to be with your lover or beloved as if he is not or she is not This is what intimacy means: if you are as if alone with your lover or beloved or your spouse in the room with no fear of the other The other is looking at you: “What will she think? What will bethink? What are you doing? Behaving like an animal?”

Tantra always starts with the body – because that's a fact. You have to start from the body because you are in the body. And That too is not right. When I say you are in the body, that too is not right.

As far as you are concerned you are the body, not in the body.

You are born as a body; you live as a body; you become ill as a body;you are treated, given medicine, helped, made whole and healthy, as a body.

You become young as a body, you will become old as a body, you will die as a body. Your whole life is body-centred. You will love someone. You will make love to someone and you will create other bodies; you will reproduce other bodies.What are you doing the whole life? Preserving yourself. What are you preserving with food, with water, with shelter? The body is preserved.What are you doing by  reproducing children? The body is  being reproduced. The whole life,  99.9% is body-oriented.

| A man who has simply suffered will become a slave and not known any moments of happiness will not be really alive.

There will be no struggle, no adventure. he will not move and fall unconscious | A man who has not suffered and remained always on happiness, in comfort will always remain on the surface.

_Illusions deceive, colors circumscribe, even divisibles are indivisible._

When dreams can be felt as real, why can reality not be felt as dream?Shankara says with senses there is no possibility to know whether thething confronting you is real or unreal

The whole world is like rainbow colors, Ifyou reach to a point where you were seeing a rainbow, it is no more there. When you are faraway everything is hopeful; when you come nearer the hope disappears.And when you reach the goal, only ashes are there – just a dead rainbow.The colors have disappeared, and things as they appeared are not. As youfeel them to be, they are not.Even divisibles are indivisible. Your whole mathematics, your wholecalculating system, all your concepts, all your philosophy, just becomefutile. If you try to understand this illusion, your very effort confuses youmore. Nothing is certain there; everything is uncertain – a flux, a flux ofchange, with no possibility for you to decide whether this or that is true orfalse.

even for a dream to exist a real dreamer is needed. Even for a false dream a real dreamer is needed. Even a dreamcannot exist without a real dreamer. So forget dream. This technique saysforget dream. The whole world is illusion, you are not

See in my view that’s stupid & hollow.

Will this contribute to your long term happiness?

The moments with friends & other humans are only valuable because we assign them a HOLY ELEMENT. Which makes them valuable.

If i only make friends for utility purpose then whatever happiness & meaning i will feel , will only be from utility and other small happiness will not sink in deep meaningful significance

_Or stare without moving an eyelash._

This Or stare without moving an eyelash was the method of MeherBaba. For years together he was staring just at the ceiling of his room. For Years together he was just lying dead on the floor, staring at the ceiling without moving an eyelash, without moving his eyes. He would lie down for hours together, just staring, not doing anything. Staring with the eyes is good, because you become fixed again in the third eye. And once you are fixed in the third eye, even if you want to move the eyelids you cannot;they become fixed.

_Enraged in wrath, stay so._

Even this part can become one technique. You are in anger: lie down,remain in the anger. Do not move from it, do not do anything, just remain still. Krishnamurti goes on talking about this. His whole technique depends on this single thing:

_**Enraged in wrath, stay so.**_

If you are angry then be angry, and remain angry. Do not move. If you can stay so, anger will go and you will come out a different man. If you're in anxiety, do not do anything. Remain there, stay there. The anxiety will go; you will come out a different man. And once you have looked at anxiety without being moved by it, you will be the master

_**Or suck something and become the sucking.**_

Suck something – just suck the air, but forget the air and become thesucking. What does this mean? You are sucking something; you are thesucker, not the sucking. You are standing behind and sucking.This sutra says, do not stand behind, move in the act and become thesucking. Try  anything that  will  work.  You  are  running –  become the running, do not be the runner. Become the running and forget the runner.Feel that there is no runner inside, just the process of running. You are the process, a river-like process running. Nobody is there inside. It is quiet inside and there is only a process.

Unless you become the sucking, nothing will help. So try

He told me, “It has become a problem – I want to suck the whole day. And it is so beautiful, and such deep silence is created by it.”Within three months the sucking became a very, very silent gesture.The  lips  stopped, you  couldn’t  even  have  judged that  he  was  doing something. But inner sucking had started. He was sucking the whole [day.It](http://day.It) became a mantra, a japa – a mantra repetition.After three months he came to me and said, “Something strange is happening to  me.  Something sweet  is  falling from  my  head  onto  my tongue continuously. And it is so sweet and so energy filling that I don't need any food, there is no hunger left. Eating has become just a formality.I take something in order not to create any problems in the family. But Something is continuously coming to me. It is so sweet, life-giving.”

I told him to continue. Three months more, and one day he came justmad, dancing to me, and he said, “Sucking has disappeared, but I am a different man. I am no more the same man who had come to you. Somedoor has opened within me. Something has broken and there is no desire left. Now I do not want anything – not even God, not even moksha –liberation. I do not want anything. Now everything is okay as it is. I accept it and I am blissful.''Try  this.  Just  suck  something and  become the  sucking. It  may  be helpful to many because it is so basic.

_**When on a bed or a seat, let yourself become weightless, beyond mind.**_

You are sitting here. Just feel that you have become weightless, there isno weight. You will feel that somewhere or other there is weight, but go on feeling the weightlessness.

When there is no weight you are no more a body, because the weight is of the body – not of you.You are weightless.

Weightlessness is bodilessness. Then you transcend mind also. Mind is also part of the body, part of matter. Matter has weight; you do not have

any weight. This is the basis of this technique.

**Western psychology is really just  therapeutic, just a part of medicine. It  tries, it helps you to be readjusted, but  it is not a transcendence. The Eastern effort is for how to transcend the  mind,because for us there are no mental diseases, remember. For us there are no mental diseases – rather, the mind is the disease. For Western psychology the mind is not the disease. The mind is you, it is not the disease. The Mind can be healthy, and the mind can be ill.For us the mind is the disease, the mind can never be healthy. Unless you go beyond your mind, you can never be healthy. You can  be ill and adjusted or you can be ill and maladjusted, but you can never be [healthy.So](http://healthy.So) the normal man is not really healthy.**

**All these techniques can be used for ordinary mental peace, and all these techniques can also be used for a real silence which is not of the mind.There are two types of silence: one of the mind, in which the mind is silent, and another silence when the mind is no more. The silence when the mind is no more, is altogether different from mental peace. In mental peace the mind is there, only not very mad. The madness is slowed down– that is all.**

**Boredom is just the cover, the container in which is contained your inner nothingness — SHUNYATA. If you escape from boredom, you are escaping from your own nothingness. If you don’t escape from boredom, if you start living with it, if you start accepting it, welcoming it….**

**if you go on watching, watching, watching, boredom becomes bigger and bigger, intenser and intenser, more suffocation and then the peak comes you are almost killed but… nothing can go on forever. There is a point from where the wheel turns. If you can go to the very extreme, to the very peak, then the change, transformation, enlightenment, satori, or whatever you want to call it, happens.**

**I give you this name so that it reminds you again and again -- never search for bliss in the outside. Nobody else can give you that which you need. Only you can give that gift to yourself; nobody else can give it to you. So there is no need to beg. One has just to claim it -- to go in and claim it.**

| Let attention be at a place where you are seeing   some past happening, and even your form,

having lost its present characteristics, is transformed.

Remember the past or the probable future as if the whole thing doesn’t belong to you. Be attentive, aware, a witness, remaining aloof.

As if someone else were loving someone else.

You are just a witness, an observer

He is not insulting you, he can never insult you. He is insulting the form that was in the afternoon.

Old form has gone now.

You are like a flowing river:- Changing continuously every breath

Unwind daily, the whole day before sleep and

In the morning when you feel that you have awakened, do not open your eyes immediately, go back.

Things come and go upon it without touching it in the least.

You remain innocent, untouched; you remain virgin.

The whole thing passes, the whole life passes: good and bad, success and failure, praise and blame – everything passes.

Disease and health, youth and old age, birth and death

– everything passes, and you are untouched by it.

Desire stops, because desire is nothing but the past being projected into the future, in search of another repetition again.

To leave this you have to BECOME AWARE of this whole phenomenon.

If you can know the past as a dream, all desires become impotent.

Go backward as many times it takes, till you feel that the whole past is washed away. Don’t rush, pass it slowly so that nothing is missed.

With intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches heart at the moment of sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself.

At the point of sleep, when the sleep has not yet come and external wakefulness vanishes, at this point being is revealed.

By and by, by and by, sleep is overtaking you. Within moments, your consciousness will dissolve; you will not be aware. Before that moment comes, become aware – aware of the breath and the invisible part prana,and feel it coming to the heart.

But if you move into sleep remembering the heart being filled with prana, continuously being touched by prana with every breath, you will become a master of your dreams.

While you are falling asleep, “I want to dream this dream,” and that dream will come to you. Just say over and over again while feeling your breath, while falling asleep, “I do not want to dream that dream,” and that dream cannot enter your mind.

Behaving as if the whole world is just a dream.

Whatsoever you are doing, remember this is a dream. While eating, remember this is a dream. While walking, remember this is a dream.

Let your mind continuously remember while you are awake that everything's a dream. This is the reason for calling the world maya, illusion, dream.

This is not a philosophical argument but a device

Feel “I am” Don’t verbalize Feel

Be sensitive to your being.

When you touch someone’s hand do not only touch his hand, feel your touch also, feel yourself also – that you are here in this touch, present totally. While eating, do not only eat, feel yourself eating as well. This feeling, this sensitivity must penetrate deeper and deeper into your mind.

The world is real or the “I” is real – both cannot be real

Even if for only a single moment, it will give you a glimpse.

If you can have the glimpse for a single moment, you can remain in it. Only effort is needed – a continuous effort is needed.

A single moment is given to you.

You cannot have two moments together if you can be aware in one moment, you can be aware of your whole life.

If you take life as a drama, predetermined, then it becomes a dream.

Then I can become an observer – a simple observer.

Two times when the gear of body switches (There is small gap)

- When you are:

in middle of going to sleep at night

in middle of waking up in morning

For a single moment/very brief subtle moment, there is no mechanism.

If you can become aware/awake between the two, you will have a glimpse of your real being.

**In dreaming in sleep you become identified with it, so you become a puppet in dreams who gets guided by just any identification. (story/friend/belief/desire)**

---

**In the morning, you’re aloof, you don’t get absorbed, there's a gap so you can remember that it was a dream and not a reality.**

---

**Your past is nothing more than a dream too.**

**Your Past - A false identity you call your own and clings onto.**

**A gap is there so use it to dis-identify yourself with your memory self.**

---

**That is why the world is called maya, an illusion.**

**It is not that it is unreal, but because**

**Once one becomes a witness – aware, fully aware – the whole thing drops just like a dream**

**because the space is there and you are not identified with it.**

**Identification is misery; non-identification is bliss**

---

**Man becomes elated, in his ego, by his virtues & sins. It’s stupid noone else is interested how great you are in your head.**

---

**Even for a false dream a real dreamer is needed**

---

_**Objects and desires exist in me as in others. So accepting, let them be transformed.**_

---

We have double standards – one standard for one oneself and another standard for everyone else.

**You call your sex love; others’ love you call sex.**

---

A non-condemning mind will have compassion & deep acceptance.

---

Bring everything up to the surface. Accept your humanity, animal-nature. Whatsoever is there, accept it without any condemnation. It is there, and be aware of it

---

Don’t be a false human being. Be a real animal, and with that reality you will have become authentic, substantial

---

He knows that this is how humanity is and that “this is how I am.”

Then the whole world will become just a reflection of your own self.

It will become a mirror.

Then every face becomes a mirror for you;

you look at yourself in every face

---

When some desire comes, consider it. Then, suddenly, quit it

Be aware, attentive of what is happening to you. Feel it.

Consider/’Face it!’ Without Interpretation(Not against it nor for it)

Do not exercise any judgment.

Don’t bring in thoughts

(cause no thought can be original - everything is borrowed).

Don’t suppress or control.

Now suddenly, quit it. What to do?

The desire is there; you have considered so quitting becomes easy.

When you say -  “I  quit”

A separation happens b/w the silent center & ‘lust crazed mind-body’.

No fight is there, just a separation

In a fight you are not separate

When you're against something, or someone, you cannot face it. The very being against becoming a barrier.  You  cannot consider... How  can you consider an enemy? You cannot look at him, you cannot look  into his eyes; it is difficult to face him. You can look deeply only into the eyes of one you love; then you penetrate deep.

**Energy has no form, your mind gives the form, and the energy moves into it. Energy is simply energy  –  neutral. The  same  energy  becomes anger; the  same energy becomes sex; the same energy becomes love; the same energy becomes hate. These are all forms of the same energy**

---

**Expression and suppression are two aspects of one coin.**

**Contradictory, but basically they are not different. In expression and in suppression, in both, the other is the center.**

---

**Suppression is really nothing but postponing expression.**

**This technique uses your mood, your energy, as a path for you to go deep down within yourself.**

**You are just moving down with the same energy which has come up. Every energy comes from the source, so right now the path is warm and you can use that path to go back. And the moment you reach the original source, the energy will subside into the original source. It is not suppression: the energy has gone back to the original source.**

**You have to throw it out or allow it to move back to the original source; these are the only two things.**

---

_**Feel an object before you. Feel the absence of all other objects but this one. Then leaving aside the object-feeling and the absence-feeling, realize.**_***

---

If you have chosen one rose-flower, then go on using that rose-flower every day. Be filled with it so that one day you can say,

“Now I am the flower.”

When only the flower is there and all else is forgotten, then relish this for a few days till you're attuned to it and it becomes natural

---

Then try the second part:

Close your eyes and forget the flower & object-feeling also.

Then the object is not there and only your consciousness, pure being, remains, just like a light, a flame without anything around it.

---

**Infinite Trust Infinite Compassion**

**No Fear, no Hate If Betrayed**

**ALSO WHY DO YOU EVEN USE PAST AND FUTURE(MindFalseImage)**

**USE THOUGHT WHEN COMBATING THAT I WILL NEVER BE HAPPY**

**AND IF YOU ARE USING EXTERNAL STUFF(MIND & IT’S CONTENT)**

**WHY DON’T YOU GO OUTSIDE WALK WITH CALM MIND or Hug pillow let yourself break free from emotions then**

**THEN WITH CALM MIND THINK OF i’ll never be happy .**

**ASKING QUESTION WITH BIASED WAY(USE MIND FALSE PAST FUTURE) combine with intense emotions = PERPETUATION OF THAT EMOTION**

**ALoness is not to be free of other, it's to be free of oneself**

**THE** **ONLY WAY TO STOP THIS IS UPROOTING TREE. IF I DO THAT LEAVES WILL WITHER AWAY ON THEIR OWN**

**shouldn’t think about the problems that I will face after > 3months**

**We were born centered like an animal – spontaneous, centered,grounded.**

**He cannot become part of an organization. He is disturbing. He has to be forced, cultivated and changed. In this cultivation he has to be pushed off-center**

**You yourself have become unconscious that you have a center.**

**You live what the society,the culture,the family have taught you to live.**

**You live a false life and for this a false center is needed. Thatcenter is your ego, your conscious mind. That is why, no matter what you do, you will never be blissful**

**Whenever you feel you are choosing and you are free, then too you arenot free and you are not choosing. The choice is also a mechanical thing.**

**The first two or three years are the years for imprinting, and things become fixed in the mind. Then you go on doing the same; you go on repeating in a mechanical way. You are moving in a vicious circle.**

**DISIDENTIFY YOURSELF FROM SENSATION**

**LEAVE CONTROL TO YOUR BEST SELF**

**Now this numb-sensation is going to become undertone until you sleep.**

**RULE DON’T REFLECT/ RECONSIDER/ PHILOSOPHIZE / ListenSong/ EgoEngage/ DesireDeath**

**THAT WON’T HELP CAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SUFFERING AND FIGHTING FOR SO DAMN LONG AND IN THE END IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE STILL AT SAME LEVEL JUST DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION.**

**CORE REMAINS THE SAME. THE SAME FRAGILITY. THE SAME WEAKNESS**

Cause these parasite and evil thoughts were planted in you know who know when at which small age and they are just growing and growing ever since, earlier covertly and now in the open.

**WHAT I CONTROL, HAVE FAITH IN**

**IS THE UNCONTROLLABLE, UNCHANGEABLE, THE UNTOUCHABLE CENTER.**

EMOTIONAL STATE I WILL END UP (FEELING PROUD, I AM SO SUPERIOR & Grt)

Or in -ve (I am ashamed of myself, it’s better if i have never been born)

**IT’S UPTO THE WORLD WHETHER I WILL END UP IN PLACE**

**FULL OF HAPPINESS/JOY or FULL OF MISERY/DEPRESSION**

**AGRIM(body-mind) TOO IS CONTROLLED BY UNIVERSE**

**WHETHER HE WILL HAVE ENOUGH TOOLS TO BREAK FREE OR HE WILL BE IN A STICKY TRAP, WHERE EVERYTHING FRIENDLY bcms ENEMY or VANISH**

**LUCKILY AFTER 10yrs ALL SOURCE OF AGRIM’S SUFFERING WILL FALL-APART**

**FOCUS ON USING THAT YOUTHFUL ENERGY & VIRILITY FOR MAKING YOURSELF BLOOM. DON’T LET SEASONAL FLOWERS DISTRACT YOU.**

---

This so-called universe appears as a juggling, a picture show. To be happy, look upon it so.

---

If you are unhappy, you have taken it too seriously. And don’t try to find any way to be happy.

You cannot be happy with a serious mind. With a festive mind, you can be happy. Take This whole life as a myth, as a story.

as if you are doing a part in a drama, and see the beauty of it. If you are playing a part you will try to be efficient, **but you will not get disturbed**. There is no need. You will do the part and go to sleep. Butremember, it is a part, and for seven days continuously follow this attitude.

What is wrong in being an animal? Man, through his ego, has createdcomparisons. He says, “We are not animals.” But no animal would like to be a human being. They are at ease, at home in existence. They are not worried, they are not tense

Look at a cat: she knows the secret of how to relax and she has not read any books about relaxation.

“I love a frog, even a frog, more than aman. Look at a frog sitting near a pond: how meditatively a frog sits!Look at him, how meditative he is – not disturbed by the whole worldgoing  on, just sitting and sitting and  meditating, one with existence.”

**Mind-Body are linked and both are uncontrollable.**

**When I suddenly get thrown into emotional numbness, I lose the ability to draw out emotion in words.**

**Run away but Make the transition smooth.**

**Start by continuing and asking more questions. Then withdraw into yourself and act like you are thinking something deeply, once sufficient time passess.**

**Maybe go away from the place or take out your phone, look outside the window.**

**To receive something you have to lose,**

**Otherwise you don’t even feel like you received something.**

**A fish doesn’t understand it’s swimming in water until a fisherman pulls it out. Then it understands ‘Oh! I was in the river’ Then it struggles for life. It wiggles around, cries to be back in the river.**

**We all were children but no-one got the chance to understand that prosperity. We threw it away without realizing its value.**

**It’s a battle all of us lost.**

-   Felt bad, jealous of ayush. Parth bhiya and others seemed to favor him.
-   When ayush wasn’t there i will cry the whole time

-   Mom told me, I didn't make any friends except Ayush. I was very different from normal kids and didn't make friends with anyone except ayush.

But i remember i had one friend ABHAY, but we got separated during section change and never met again.

-   I also remember I had friends - Aniket, Anmol, Nikhil Gupta, Nikhil Nain, Shorya, etc.
-   But then why? Why didn’t any of them along with Ayush Noone with me on the first trip.

They had their group and I didn’t have much group identity and a gang of friends. I was more of an individual friend with all.

-   I don’t think I envied people’s groups cuz i didn’t understand what’s the fun in that? But I wanted Ayush to be with me.
-   I wanted to be 1st in class. I worked really really hard to get 1st but ayush was leagues ahead of me and I didn't understand what was the problem.

If  you  suffer  you  have  chosen it:

consciously,unconsciously, directly, indirectly ****

**It is your choice and you are responsible.**

No one can make you suffer. That is impossible. And even if someone makes you suffer, it is your choice to suffer through him.

---

When you paradoxical relationship between happiness and suffering

You don’t choose at all.

Then nothing can happen to you

Then you are, simply –  no  misery,  no  bliss

---

You have to let yourself go. Let love takes possession

---

The heart must be allowed to use reason – not vice versa

surrender is the way – either in love or in prayer

**Your conscious mind is impotent; it cannot do anything.**

**It has to be lost, it has to be put aside**.

---

**The quality, the mood you bring into the act matters. Not the act itself.**

---

**Whatsoever you do, if you love it, it will never be repetitive. If you love your doings, your acts, there will be no boredom.**

---

**But you don’t love.**

**You have not yet accepted yourself, you have not yet thanked existence for your existence. From your heart there is no thank-you towards God. Really, you have a grudge – “Why have you created me?”**

---

Someday forget yourself and listen to the traffic noise. Just listen, and don’t bring in your attitudes that this is disturbing, that this is not good. Don’t bring in your attitudes,just listen to the melody! In the beginning it will look chaotic. That too is because of the mind. If you relax totally, sooner or later everything will fit into a harmonious whole and even the traffic noise will become music.You can enjoy it and you can dance to its tune. It depends on you.Nothing disturbs unless you think that it disturbs.

---

You're not in your head, cause you were still alive when you were in your mother's womb and your head wasn't developed.

Where is that being? if not head. Really, it is nowhere – or everywhere in your body. It is nowhere; you cannot pinpoint where it is.

It is everywhere. You will have to go to the very ends of the universe.

---

The moon in the lake, but that moon is false – just a reflection

(a small ripple and the moon will get distorted).

Mind similar to a lake reflects reality but everything wavers.

A slight wave, a slight wind, will disturb your mind.

Reality is not disturbed, but the mind is disturbed by anything.

---

**GREAT DIVIDE between story & reality REMEMBER, FEEL ONCE AGAIN**

---

**This boat is empty too**

---

**He didn’t insulted you but just your form and that is his deed**

**– and you are punishing yourself by being angry**

---

Whenever you feel you are choosing and you are free,

then too you are not free and you are not choosing.

The choice is also a mechanical thing.

---

**As waves come with water and flames with fire,**

**so the universal waves with us.**

---

Each wave has its own character, different from the other.

Their individuality is false and illusory.

They are non-individual. Their duality appears to be,

but it is not so: their non-duality is the truth.

The ocean can be silent or in movement or in much activity or in noactivity, but you cannot find a silent wave

---

The problem is that the wave (ego) thinks itself separate from the ocean;

---

Look at life as an ocean, feel yourself just as a wave, and allow this feeling to enter in you.

---

A sex desire arises in you: feel it – not as your desire, but just as the ocean waving in you, just as life pulsating.

---

**Who are you? Just a nothingness, shunya – a void**.

With that feeling of nothingness all your misery will disappear, because misery needs a center – and a false center at that

---

When you feel yourself as a wave, you are against the universal law, youare against the reality. Then you will create misery for yourself.

---

_**Simply disconnect this idea of having happiness from things. Disconnect it from without; reconnect it with within.**_

---

**Be open – and in the very opening of yourself, all that is negative inexistence disappears.**

**Nothing is negative.Your fear creates negativity.**

**Because of that fear you create safety measures. Against those safety measures the enemy exists**

**The more you deny, the more you defend, the more you protect, the more enemies are created. They exist in your interpretation not outside.**

---

**Becoming simple & innocent like kids again is nice cuz person has realized the worthlessness of complexity.**

**Pursuit of desire never ends.**

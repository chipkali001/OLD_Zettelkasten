His eyes were glued to the elf girl as she appeared to approach climax.
Drawn by the noise, he walked over and found a spring.
To be frank, you are the first elf I have ever met.
The Gallant elf is in action to save her brethren.
He thought maybe the king had finally shown up, but no.
“You are looking as lovely as ever, princess.” “Is His Highness feeling well?” “Please spare a few words for my son.”
They all started speaking at once (speaking all at once) and Emilia appeared to be politely answering them all, but the crowd blocked Kyle’s view.

 If he failed to do that, he would have endured the awkward party for nothing.

“Um, excuse me. Please let me through. Excuse me.”

He pushed through the crowd to reach Emilia in the center.

He gathered his resolve and shouted her name.

She slowly looked over…and their eyes met.

She had grown into a breathtakingly beautiful woman.

She still had the beauty he had seen at that spring, but now she had the body of a 20-year-old human. The hair like golden silk, the eyes like pure blue lakes, and the milky skin were all exactly as he remembered them.

She realized who he was the instant she saw his face. She realized the boy she had once saved had come here all grown up.

A royal had to meet and speak with so many people it was necessary for them to have an excellent memory for faces, but Kyle was still pleased.

Enough to feel satisfied with the trip even if he never managed to speak with her.

The wall of nobles was forming in front of him again.

He had only managed to meet her gaze for a brief moment.

But the moment after that, the great hall was struck by a rumbling boom so loud it threatened to knock the happy memory from his mind.

 

“What was that!?” “A quake!?” “That was an explosion!”

The nobles were rattled.

The hall’s door burst open and an armored soldier stormed in.

He spoke with a voice far too loud for the gorgeous party.

“W-we are under attack! A dark elf army is approaching from the eastern plains! They will arrive at the capital in two hours and they number 12 thousand!”

Panic immediately set in.

The dark elves were a race of elves with a different history to the Finegard elves. They did not belong to the kingdom and lived a nomadic lifestyle.

They had long been enemies of the kingdom and would occasionally attack.

But those attacks were only ever raiding parties of a few dozen attacking small villages. An army of more than 10 thousand attacking the capital was a first in the kingdom’s history.

The nobles began to flee the hall.

Some even ran from the palace, boarded their carriages, and escaped the capital.

Even though the nobles were meant to double as knights who protected the king and fought the enemy.

But peace had lasted for so long that the greater nobles had grown complacent in their position and lost all pride as warriors.

The great hall now sat mostly empty.

While the nobles had fled away from the castle, Emilia moved deeper inside.

Kyle noticed and hurried after her.

 

“Please wait, Princess!”

He called out to Emilia in the corridor.

“Who the hell are you!?” demanded a female knight in a royal guard uniform.

A uniformed maid also moved between him and the princess.

“It’s okay, you two.” Emilia had them back down and then faced Kyle. “You are Baron Kyle Vermilion, yes? Thank you very much for attending the party, but I am afraid we do not have time to discuss old memories at the moment. I have to go.”

Old memories? She really did remember him!
He wanted to jump for joy, but he restrained himself.

“Where to? You aren’t going to fight the dark elves, are you?”
“…”

Emilia’s silence was as clear a confirmation as she could have given him.

“That’s reckless!” he shouted. “You barely have any magic at the moment, right? You can’t possibly fight like that!”

“…!”

Her eyes widened.

She was surprised that he could tell she was magically deficient.

The royals generally used recovery magic, but Princess Emilia was famous for being a rare royal user of powerful lightning magic.

She could maybe stop the dark elf army with that power, but only if she had sufficient magic within her.

“How did you know the princess is short on magic!?” asked the knight, growing even more wary of him.

“I can tell. It’s a necessary skill for my recovery magic,” he answered.

That was true. Using his recovery magic required the ability to view the target’s magic.

He had noticed as soon as he saw her.

Emilia had a chronic magic deficiency. A royal could not let such a disability be known, so it must have been a constant source of worry for her.

He did not know what caused it, but…

“Can anyone else here use magic like yours, princess?”

“No. Most of the capital guards are out training.”

Emilia shook her head.

What tragic timing. Or maybe the enemy had been waiting for just such an opportunity.

“If you understand the situation, then scram!” yelled the knight. “We need to get going.”

“You’re going to let her fight in that state? It’s too dangerous!”

“Not a problem! I, Rosetta, shall protect her with my life! Or are you suggesting there is something you can do!?”

“Well…”

He clenched his fist.

There was in fact something he could do.

Yes. This was a crisis for the entire kingdom and, more importantly, he could save Emilia. If he wasn’t going to use his power now, when would he use it?

“I can…restore the princess’s magic.”

 

After that, Kyle was taken to Emilia’s bedroom.

He was alone with Emilia. The knight named Rosetta and the maid had been sent to a different room. Given what he was going to do with Emilia, he could not have anyone else around.

“Baron Vermilion, can you really restore my magic?”

Emilia sounded skeptical.

Of course she was. Natural magic restoration took around three days. With a recovery mage speeding up the process, it still took a full night. Magic was a power created within the elf’s own body. Recovery magic could only boost the body’s own restoration.

Restoring it in the two hours before the dark elf army arrived was unheard of.

But Kyle nodded.

And he told her what this would require.

“But, Princess. To do this…”

He paused.

“You must have sex with me.”

 

“Huh?”

Emilia’s jaw dropped in a look not at all befitting a royal.

Then anger covered her face.

“Out! Now!” she shouted, pointing at the door.

(Yeah, that’s probably the only way this was ever gonna go.)

He had expected this, but it was still a bit of a shock.

“I let you into my bedroom because I trusted you! And yet you try to pull a filthy trick like this during a crisis!? Have you no shame!? Rosetta!”

She approached the door to call for the knight, but he moved in her way.

“Out of the way!”

It pained him to see her glaring at him with tears in her eyes, but he refused to obey.

Instead, he grabbed her arms, kept her from moving, and pushed her onto the bed.

“Please forgive me, Princess.”

“No…ngh.”

After a heartfelt apology, he placed his lips on hers.

She resisted, but he was a man. She could not force him off of her and her untouched lips were easily stolen.

And Kyle did not stop there.

“No…ah, nh…hh.”

His tongue parted her lips and teeth and forced its way inside her mouth.

It wriggled like it had a mind of its own to slowly rub along the back of her gums.

“Kh…ahh.”

Emilia let out a ticklish sigh, lifting her tongue enough for his to capture it.

Her tongue tried to escape, but his refused to let go.

Their saliva mixed together, formed bubbles, and made an indecent sound in the process.

(This is not how I wanted my first kiss!)
Despair filled Emilia and she gradually lost the strength needed to resist.

The way Kyle’s tongue forcibly toyed with hers felt like he was groping her entire body.

Eventually, his tongue pulled away, leaving plenty of saliva deep in her throat.

Their lips parted and a string of saliva bridged the gap between until gravity pulled it down to the corner of her mouth.

“Ah, gh…how dare- gulp.”

She started to protest and swallowed his saliva on reflex. It was disgusting and she wanted to cough it back up. It made her feel…

“Huh?”

Something felt wrong.

Kyle had already moved off of her and he spoke once she noticed the effect.

“How do you feel, Princess? Has some of your magic been restored?”

He already knew the answer. He could see the increased magic flowing through her magic circuit. Not much, but some.

“Yes. What is this?”

“This is my recovery magic. Through the medium of sexual arousal, my power stimulates the target’s magic circuit and greatly increases its recovery rate.”

It sounded like one of the worst excuses for getting into someone’s pants anyone had ever come up with, but it was the truth.

Kyle’s recovery magic was an extremely specialized type that worked through the medium of sex acts.

 

Historically, there had been other elves with a similar type of recovery magic as their specialty.

But elves lived long lives and they rarely died of illness or injury due to being partially made of magic, so their reproductive drives were extremely weak. They rarely showed interest in sexual things or sought out sexual acts.

As a result, very little research had been done on recovery magic performed through sex acts. Even when someone did decide to research it, it was not carried on after their death and no one bothered preserving their work.

Thus, Kyle had been forced to improve his recovery magic skills without any help.

But he had an advantage the other elves did not.

He had memories of his past life as a boy in modern Japan.

Sex was everywhere in that modern society. He had held a particular interest in manga, anime, video games, and internet porn, so he had far greater knowledge and curiosity about sex than the other elves. He had used all of that to build up this sexual recovery magic.

 

Of course, no one was going to believe him when he told them about it.

So he had stolen Emilia’s lips as a last-ditch gamble.

The simplest form of his magic was to induce recovery through the oral transfer of saliva. It was weak, but the effects were near immediate and it worked on pretty much any shape of magic circuit.

“So…it’s true, then?” asked Emilia, sitting back up on the bed. “Baron Vermilion, can you fully restore my magic if I have se- if I sleep with you?”

“I guarantee it,” he said with a straight face.

He found it unbearably cute how she had been unable to use the word “sex” and rephrased it, but letting it show might lose him what little trust he had just earned, so he worked to keep a straight face.

Finally, she gave a resolute nod.

“Understood. …This is the only way to save Finegard. I was raised to do whatever I could for the kingdom. I just never imagined it would mean this.”

“Thank you!”

“However. If it turns out you are lying…there will be consequences.”

“Of course. Chop me to pieces, burn me at the stake, or whatever else.”

He actually smiled as he answered, but that did not mean he wasn’t nervous.

He had asked his mansion’s maids and some of the inn town’s sex workers to help him practice, but this was the first time he truly needed to succeed.

But he could not give his partner the appropriate pleasure if he was a mess of nerves and then the recovery would fail. He needed to remain calm and lead Emilia through it.

He gently touched her shoulder and spoke.

“First, please remove your clothing and lie on the bed.”

“Eh? Um, do I have to take them off?”

“I’m afraid so. I need to inspect the shape of your magic circuit before we begin.”

“Um…so my underwear too?”

“Of course.”

“Very well. But, um, please turn around.”

He obeyed and listened to the rustle of clothing behind him.

“May I turn back around?” he asked shortly after it stopped.

“…Yes.”

He did so.

She was lying on the bed with her removed clothing next to her. But she had the blanket pulled up over her.

“I do apologize, Princess, but we are short on time. Excuse me.”

“Ah…”

He forcibly pulled away the blanket, finally revealing her nudity.

He was immediately spellbound.

Her milky-skinned body had grown up fantastically. She had the slim arms and legs of elf royalty. The rest of her also looked skinny enough to break in his arms, but her breasts were one major exception. Yet their size did not look out of balance with the rest of her body. In fact, it added to her charm.


“Ah…this is so embarrassing.”

She covered her chest and crotch with her arms and twisted her body. She could not look him in the eye.

Her innocent behavior eliminated his nerves.

“Please try and relax. Close your eyes and imagine you are falling asleep.”

“Okay…”

She shut her eyes as requested.

He grabbed her arms and placed them at her sides.

“Ah…”

She started to resist, but then relaxed like he had asked.

That revealed her pink nipples and her crotch guarded by a whisp of blonde hair.

Her nipples were small and cute and her areolae were small too. Enough so that he wondered if she had barely teased them herself.

Her crotch had barely changed since he had seen it at the spring so long ago. The labia had developed a little more, giving the slit a more adult look, but it still looked unusually young for her age.

Kyle was tempted to touch those erogenous zones right away, but he resisted and ran his hands along the rest of her body.

He could tell the general shape of her magic circuit by sight, but he had to restore her magic fast. That required the more accurate assessment his hands could give him.

He gathered magic in his hands and used that to investigate her body. It was something like a CT scan in the modern world.

“Nh, ah…hh.”

Every time his hands touched a sensitive spot, her voice would escape her lips. She resisted it in order to relax like he had asked, but it sounded more like she was suppressing sexual moans, which made his heart pound.

But he made sure to do the scan right.

He now understood the exact shape of her magic circuit from head to toe.

“Um…how does it look? Can you restore my magic right away?”

“Yes. I should really explain the process to you first. Simply put, my recovery magic stimulates the primary focal point of the magic circuit to induce magic recovery. Everyone’s focal point is in a different location. I call it their recovery point, but…”

He hesitated a moment before revealing the truth.

“Your recovery point is your g-spot.”

“My jee spot?”

Emilia tilted her head with her eyes still shut.

That was to be expected. It was not even a matter of inexperience. The term simply did not exist in this world. An equivalent term might exist among the humans in this world, but he doubted the nearly sexless elves would even know the spot existed.

“If you stimulate that jee spot, my magic will recover?”

“Yes. That much is certain.”

“Then please hurry! The dark elves are approaching as we speak! Please stimulate my jee spot!”

Emilia clenched her fists in front of her chest and made an earnest plea.

Kyle was putting off explaining where exactly the g-spot was located because he was afraid she would refuse once she knew, but that had inadvertently gotten her to say that lewd line.

But he managed to keep the excitement out of his voice.

“Your wish is my command, princess. Now, let us begin.”

He placed his hand on her stomach.

Her stomach was so thin he wondered if there was any flesh other than her organs in there, but her navel had a nice shape. He slowly slid his hand down toward her vulva.

“Eh? Um, Baron Vermilion…hyah!”

Realizing where his hand was headed, her eyes widened and she lifted her upper body a bit.

She tried to reach out and grab his arm, but it was already too late.

His fingers passed her thin golden bush and arrive at her small crevice.

“Nh…”

A tremor immediately ran through her body.

Only she had ever touched her there. The fact that someone else was doing so – and a man at that – caused her entire body to heat up.

“Wait…please wait, Baron Vermilion. You mustn’t touch me th- ahn!”

She resisted with embarrassment and humiliation coloring her face, but he wrapped his arm around her and her arms, effectively restraining her.

She had no way to escape now.

To more easily hold her from diagonally behind, he placed his hand between her legs and traced his fingers along her labia.

“Ah, wait, ah, ahhh, how dare, no, that place, so embarrassing, ahh!”

Each time his middle finger moved up and down the slit, her voice left her with a sigh.

She closed her legs out of embarrassment, but that did nothing to stop his finger.

(This is how she usually does it on her own, right?)
He felt a sticky dampness growing at her crotch.

Compared to humans, elves’ personalities and interests did not change much over their lives. There had been a good chance she still masturbated how she had at that spring so long ago. If that were the case, he had guessed the method would help put her at ease and provide the most pleasure. He was right.

The g-spot was his final objective, but he had to prepare her body for it first.

He gradually changed the movements of his middle finger, moving it side to side as well as up and down. He loosened up her labia while pushing them open little by little. He also made sure to stimulate her clitoris with the lightest of touches from time to time.

“Ah, eh, this isn’t, ah, how it normally, ahn, feels.”

Emilia realized her body was reacting strangely.

At first, it was only because Kyle was doing the same “naughty” thing she always did to herself.

But as the movement of his finger grew, she was hit by a strange new feeling.

Each time his finger moved, it provided a powerful stimulus, like her blood was flowing back up from her pussy to her heart.

She only got a little wet when doing it herself, but now she was wetter than she had thought possible.

And then there were those occasional touches of the sensitive point at the very top of her vulva.

She had already known how much pleasure it could provide, but that powerful pleasure had made her feel like she was doing something wrong and she had tried to avoid touching it if she could resist.

Kyle, on the other hand, showed no such restraint.

Each time he pushed at it, the pleasure was so great her mind numbed over.

“This…this is weird. I feel funny.”

The arms that had initially tried to pull his arm away were now hanging limply at her sides and the legs she had closed were now spreading wide to accept his hand.

The rhythmic sound coming from her pussy almost sounded like someone chewing on something sticky.

(Why am I so wet? Is my body broken somehow?)

She feared something was wrong, but she was surprised to find the lewd sound actually amplified the pleasure she was feeling.

“Ah, ah, ah, ah.”

“How is it, Princess? Does it hurt any?”

“N-not at…all. In fact, it f-feels really good.”

She did her best to get her answer out.

He was relieved to hear it.

His index and little fingers were already spreading her crevice with his middle and ring fingers stirring up the vulva within.

She was no longer resisting, so he let her upper body rest on the bed and shifted his position to view her pussy.

She was completely flooded down there.

She appeared to have an extremely sensitive body, so he guessed she had avoided pleasuring herself too much when masturbating out of a belief that it was wrong.

Her beautiful pink pussy gave off a feminine scent and soaked the sheets with its love juices.

(Her vagina has loosened up a lot too, but it’s just naturally small. I should probably make her cum once first.)

With that decided, he sped up his fingers.

He also pressed harder against her clitoris, increasing the waves of stimulation.

“Eh? What? That’s so, ahhhh!”

“Feels good, doesn’t it?”

“It does, but…it’s so…powerful! Ah, what, how is it so powerful!?”

The tingling pleasure made her speak out loud.

Her heart was pounding so hard she thought it would burst.

Her lower body moved against her will, rubbing her clit against his finger.

Feeling “good” was an understatement. Her hips went wild to get more of the great pleasure from that thing she had barely touched herself. She knew how shameful she must look, but she could not stop herself.

“O-oh, no. There’s something wrong with…my body!”

“There isn’t. This is normal. Don’t fear it and just let it happen. This is necessary for-”

“For your…recovery magic!?”

“Exactly.

So she had no choice.

Maybe what she was doing was wrong, but it was to restore her magic.

Then she could use her recovered magic to repel the dark elves.

She could save the capital and the kingdom.

This was a necessary task!
Princess Emilia had always been an earnest and hard worker, so she always fulfilled her duty as a royal. That had included prizing her chastity and resisting the urge to masturbate like she had when she was a girl.

But now her duty to the kingdom demanded she remove that restriction.

She released the final mental lock and opened the door to the pleasure she had closed away so long ago.

“There…I like it there! When you touch me there, it feels so good it’s like I’m floating! Like I’m going to fly away. So do it more! Touch me more! Ahh!”

“Like this?”
Kyle used his middle finger to loosen up her slit while using his index finger to knead her clitoris. Her labia were now plenty wet and no longer needed his fingers to hold them open. They were ready to accept him.

Emilia clutched at the sheets because she felt like she would float away if she did not.

“Yes, there, like that, more, ah, ah, I’m cumming, I’m cumming so harrrrrrrd!!!!”

Tremors ran through her body as she accepted the pleasure.

Then she collapsed limp onto the bed.

She somehow managed to get her words out through her heavy breathing.

“Did that…activate your recovery magic? Is the jee spot…another word for the clitoris?”
Kyle smiled bitterly as he answered.

“No, that was not the g-spot.”

“Eh?”

“I mean, your magic hasn’t recovered, has it?”

“Oh…you’re right.”

She did have a bit more magic than before, but it was far from a full recovery.

“You can think of that like a warmup exercise necessary for you to accept the magic. I will begin the real magic now.”

“Oh, no…”

Emilia felt despair.

She had put up with all of that and let him see her behaving so indecently, but it was only the warmup?

Could she not recover her magic without doing something far, far greater?

(Eh? Wait.)

She noticed something odd about her feelings.

She was facing something far greater than before, yet she felt no fear or displeasure.

Instead, a great anticipation bubbled up within her.

(But…but that would mean…)
She needed to recover her magic, so she had accepted that humiliation to save her kingdom.

So why did she feel this way?

“We have no time. Excuse me.”
“Ah.”

She was not given time to think it through.

Kyle spread her legs even wider than before and slid his body in between them.

Then he carefully observed her fully exposed pussy.

It was still fairly small, but it was fully melted and hot enough he half expected it to have steam rising from it.

Her thin blonde pubic hair was plastered to her skin by the love juices.

He touched it.

He ran his finger up and down her vulva a few times to check its shape and then he gently pushed his middle finger into her vagina.

“Ahhhh!? N-not in there! You can’t! Not there!”

That surprised Emilia and she tried to resist, but she was weak so soon after orgasming and could not escape or fight it.

He slowly but surely pushed his finger inside her.

Her vagina was surprisingly tight. Almost like it was rejecting anything that might enter it.

But after his finger moved a bit further in, her vagina squeezed at his finger, like it was never going to let it go again.

Her pussy was also shockingly wet and hot.

The princess appeared to be sensitive here as well.

(Is that her hymen? It’s shaped like a ring along the vaginal walls. If I do this right, I should be able to keep the pain to a minimum.)

With a virgin, the pain could reduce their sexual arousal and prevent the magic recovery.

He had been worried about that ever since discovering her recovery point was her g-spot, but it looked like it would not be a problem.

(Now, where is the crucial g-spot?)
He pushed his finger deep inside and lifted it up to press against the vaginal wall and search for the g-spot.

“Ah, hh, ah, ahhn.”

Emilia moaned with every move of his finger.

Even without directly hitting her g-spot, he was providing a lot of pleasure. Her moans were even louder than when he was rubbing her labia and she could not suppress them at all.

“Princess, which do you feel more: this…or this?”

“Ahhn! The, ah, second one was…amazing! But I think even further in…would be even better! Ahhhhhhhn!!”

As requested, he pushed his finger in as far as it would go and then pushed at the vaginal wall, causing her body to tremble and even louder moans.

The center of her pleasure appeared to be fairly deep inside.

He knew where it was.

That just left stimulating it, increasing her sexual pleasure, and activating her magic circuit.

But there was a problem.

(My finger can’t reach it.)

He could just barely reach when he strained, but he could not provide the continuous stimulation needed to recover her magic.

With more time, he could have found a dildo to use, but time was too tight.

(I don’t see any other option.)

He pulled his finger out of her vagina.

“Ahh.”

Even that was enough to send a tremor through her body. A string of love juices connected her crevice to his finger, like she did not want to let him go.

“Umm.”

“Yes?”

“Are you done?”
The way she looked when she asked that made his heart skip a beat.

The princess looked unbelievably hot.

Her cheeks were flushed, her mouth was hanging open, and saliva was dripping from it. The tears in her blue eyes made them shine like quartz.

Her chest rose and fell in time with her heavy breathing and her arms and legs lay limp on the bed. She looked thoroughly exhausted, but her labia were trembling with desire.

Seeing that filled Kyle with the most powerful emotion he had ever felt.

He wanted to put his dick inside her.

He wanted to stir her up inside and fuck her silly.

He stripped off his slacks and underwear to reveal his lower body.

His penis was at full erection without him ever touching it.

“Is that…?”
Emilia gasped, her eyes widening.

There was a hint of fear on her face, but she could not take her eyes off of that strangely-shaped organ that she lacked.

“No, I am not done, Princess,” he slowly answered. “It turns out I need to use this to reach your g-spot.”

“Use…that?”
She could not believe her ears.

How could something that thick fit inside her?

His finger just now had felt like it was spreading her to the limit, but that monstrous thing growing from his crotch was several times thicker.

If he pushed that inside her…

“Ah…”

That strange feeling hit her again.

She felt anticipation instead of fear or displeasure.

When she imagined that giant thing inside her, she felt a squeezing sensation deep inside.

“Ahhhn!”

“Are you okay, Princess? Are you afraid?”

“No, I’m not. I mean, I should be, but for some reason, um…when I heard you would be using that thing, I won’t stop twitching down here.”

“!”
When she gestured toward her pussy and said that, his penis throbbed wildly.

She was extremely horny and that was what made her so beautiful.

“Going all the way should stop that twitching as well, so we can kill two birds with one stone.”

“All the way?”

“Yes, all the way.”

He gently placed his penis against her vulva. He rubbed up and down it a few times to coat his dick with love juices.

Then he brought the head to the vaginal entrance.

“Excuse me, Princess.”

He slowly parted her vagina with his cock.

“Nhhhhhhhhhh!?”

A pained voice left her mouth.

“Are you okay?”

“I’m…fine.”

She panted like a dog on a hot day and somehow managed to answer him.

He could not rush this, so he moved in and out of the entrance a few times.

The ridge of the head rubbed at her vaginal walls, creating a tingling pleasure.

Finally, her love juices provided enough lubrication to help him move more easily. He gradually pushed deeper inside her.

Then he felt something breaking.

It was her hymen.

His invading cock had broken the barrier that guarded the source of her pleasure.

“Ugh, ah, ahh.”

“Does it hurt?”

“A…little. But more than that…”
“Yes?”

“More than that…I want it deeper inside me. Hurry.”

How could he resist after hearing that?

He adjusted the position of his knees and pushed his hips the rest of the way forward.

The full length of his penis sank inside her vagina.

“Kyahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”

Something burst in her mind when he did.

She thought his rod-like organ had suddenly grown much larger and pierced the entirety of her body.

The sensation racing up to her mind was simply that powerful. Her vision went blank and light burst in her mind’s eye.

“What? This is…so much better…than before. Ah, gh, ghhh!”

The difference was unbelievable.

As soon as his penis head touched her g-spot, her hips hopped up, her torso twisted, and she thrashed about like a child throwing a tantrum. Her large breasts jiggled from all the movement. The pleasure was so great she had reflexively moved to reject it.

But it did not end there.

Kyle grabbed her thighs, lifted them, and then started thrusting in and out of her, the head stimulating her g-spot more and more each time.

“Kyah, kyah, wait, nh! That’s too powerful, Baron, it’s too much!”

“Don’t fight it, Princess. This is your recovery point. This will restore your magic.”

“This is? So this is my jee spot?”

“Yes. It is the focal point of your magic circuit. That means it is also the most pleasurable point in your body.”

“It is! My jee spot feels so good! I didn’t know anything could feel so good! More! Give me more of your penis!”


“Cock. Call it my cock.”

“Your cock! Move your cock in and out of me! Pound me deep inside with it! Right on my jee spot! I want more! So much more!”

The magic recovery barely even mattered anymore.

Emilia had forgotten all about the dark elf army and her kingdom as she focused on nothing more than the pleasure deep inside her body.

She now knew that she had only ever experienced the beginnings of the pleasure she was capable of feeling.

She had never known such an amazing spot existed deep inside that hole.

Having someone else discover this secret of her body should have been so embarrassing she wanted to die, but she didn’t even care.

She just wanted him to pound her more.

She wanted to be filled with so much pleasure that her body and mind were a complete mess and she could only focus on the pounding on her g-spot.

“I’m going to cum again! But…but even harder than last tiiiiiiiiime!”
“That last one was only a smaller one, so maybe this will be your first truly powerful orgasm.”

“Really? They’re supposed to feel this good?”

“They are. So get ready and enjoy it.”

“Ahh, I’m cumming♥ Your cock is pounding me and hitting my jee spot! I can barely think anymore! I! I feel like! I feel like I’m just one big jee spot♥♥”

Kyle moved his hips even harder. Love juices flowed from her vagina, causing wet sounds with every thrust he made.

“Incredible♥♥ Something is filling my body! I can’t stop it! I love it! It just keeps happening when you hit my jee spot! So do it more! Restore my magic with your cock and make me cuuuuuuuuum♥♥♥♥♥”

The pleasure hit Emilia like a powerful firework bursting.

She did not have control of any part of her body.

Tears spilled from her eyes, drool flowed from the mouth she could not close, and her hands clutched the sheets.

Her legs trembled like a newborn fawn while Kyle kept them lifted.

Her vagina squeezed rhythmically like it did not want his penis to leave.

“Princess…” he muttered while watching her orgasm.

It had been necessary to restore her magic, but it finally hit home that he had taken her virginity.

He had told himself he had only come to the party to thank her…but that had been a lie.

He had been in denial about his feelings.

In truth, he had wanted to do this.

He had wanted to make love to her ever since he first saw her naked when they were kids.

Emilia had been his first love.

“…”

But now was not the time to confess those selfish feelings.

He held his tongue and slowly pulled his penis out of her.

He had not ejaculated, so only some love juices mixed with a hint of red spilled from her vagina.

“Princess, your magic has been fully restored.”

He hid his own feelings away and stuck to his role as the noble fulfilling his obligations to the royal family.

 

“Spirits, hear my call. My name is Emilia, the one bound to you by contract.

“Spirits, gather here and grant me your power. My name is Emilia, the one who wishes to seed her lightning power.

“Spirits, Emilia seeks your power, so please grant it!”

 

When Emilia raised her staff and recited the spirit magic incantation, she looked like an entirely different person from a few minutes ago.

After writhing in pleasure in bed, she had donned her dress, stepped out onto the royal palace’s balcony, and faced the approaching dark elf army.

She recited the incantation with such perfect enunciation it was hard to believe this was the same woman who had been shouting lewd words between moans earlier.

She was accompanied by the knight named Rosetta, the green-haired maid, and Kyle.

The three of them watched as she waved her staff.

When she raised her voice again, blinding light appeared out of thin air and crashed down toward the ground east of the capital.

The rumble reached the palace after a short delay.

“Incredible,” gasped Kyle.

He had never seen such powerful magic.

This was the power of the heir to Finegard’s throne.

The one attack reduced a portion of the field to black charcoal.

The dark elf army had not expected any kind of attack yet, so they were easily routed. Their horses panicked and the cavalry fell apart. The infantry dropped their weapons and fled.

The army of 12 thousand dark elves was forced to withdraw after a single lightning magic attack by Princess Emilia.


Elf Harem Chapter 2: The Mouth is for Sex – A Knight’s Blowjob Orgasm
“Um, Rosetta?”
“Hmph.”
“Rosetta?”
“Hmph!”
It had been like this the entire way.
They were one day’s travel away from the royal capital. Except for when they stopped for the night, Kyle had been stuck in the same carriage as Rosetta, but they had not had an actual conversation the entire time.
He had already known this royal knight didn’t like him and this just confirmed it.
A few days had passed since Princess Emilia’s lightning magic repelled the dark elf army.
Kyle had indirectly saved the capital and the Finegard Kingdom as a whole by restoring Emilia’s magic, so now he found himself riding a carriage along a mountain road to rescue a certain fortress.
To discover how he ended up there, we must look back in time a bit.
 


The night after the dark elf army had been repelled, Kyle was taken to the castle basement by Emilia, Rosetta, and Emilia’s maid (her name turned out to be Claris).
They led him to a silent room at the far end of a hallway.
But this was not a cell. The door was very nice and it lacked a lock to keep it shut.
In modern Japanese terms, it was most reminiscent of a morgue.
“Princess Emilia.”
They opened the door to reveal a single bed inside. The middle-aged elf seated next to the bed spoke up when he noticed them. He was Finegard’s prime minister.
“What of the dark elves?”
“I drove them away. This man restored my magic.”
“That’s wonderful news!” rejoiced the prime minister.
Kyle was unsure how to respond to being made the center of attention.
Not when his eyes were glued to the old man lying on the bed.
He had long gray hair and enough facial hair to cover much of his face. The visible part of his face had deep wrinkles, proving he was extremely old even by elf standards.
But it was obvious at a glance that the dignified person in the bed was no longer among the living.
“The king is…?”
He had never before seen the king, but he knew who this had to be.
“Yes,” said Emilia. “Father…the king has already left us.”
 
They said it had happened about half a month ago.
He was already very old and could have died at any time. The cause of death was old age and no foul play was suspected.
But the timing had been unfortunate.
The nobility across the kingdom had already been sent invitations to his 5000th birthday.
They could not cancel it at that point. Especially when the people were already feeling uneasy with the increased activity among the dark elves. They could not reveal the king’s death at that time.
 
“So we decided to keep it a secret until the dark elf problem was less prominent.”
“I see.”
It made sense to Kyle. This also explained Emilia’s lack of magic. Her father’s death and the need to meet with the nobles while hiding that fact would have put her under a lot of stress.
Her mother, the queen, had already died, so she had needed to act in the king’s place all on her own.
“That must have been difficult.”
Emilia looked unsteady on her feet, so he reached a hand to her shoulder to support her. She had to be exhausted after the sex to restore her magic and after performing such powerful magic.
But Rosetta moved between the two of them.
She very blatantly blocked Kyle’s hand.
“As you can see, the princess is tired. You are at least willing to protect the princess – unlike all those other incompetent nobles – but you are still a poor noble from the boonies. There is nothing you can do in this time of crisis. Hurry back to your territory.”
“If you say so…”
He had no real rebuttal for that.
“Rosetta!”
But Emilia rebuked Rosetta.
“How can you be so ungrateful? Baron Vermilion, um, well, he did what needed doing to restore my magic! He might even be Finegard’s legendary hero.”
“He most certainly is not!”
Rosetta had already looked upset, but now she wrinkled her brow and growled in frustration.
 
Finegard had a few different legends.
In ancient times, the kingdom was founded by Finegard I, who was said to be a great mage, and he had made a few different prophecies. One of them is as follows: “When the wise king falls and a crisis befalls the kingdom, one with miraculous healing powers shall arrive, inherit the throne, and save the kingdom.”
Emilia was claiming Kyle could be the “one with miraculous healing powers”.
Sure enough, the absurd method for his powers could, in a way, be called “miraculous”.
 
Emilia and Rosetta continued arguing.
They had been together from a young age, so they had a bond of friendship that surpassed their official roles.
But that was actually why Rosetta so disliked Kyle for winning Emilia’s trust so quickly and easily.
(Protecting the princess is my job!)
Kyle was reluctant to intrude on those two’s conversation, so it was the prime minister who spoke up.
“How about this then? Madam Rosetta can see for herself if Baron Vermilion is worthy of trust and if his recovery magic is as effective as he claims.”
 
The elites of the royal guard had been running some exercises at a fortress located a day’s travel through the mountains, but they could not return because a dark elf unit had blocked the mountain path.
The prime minister suggested Kyle accompany Rosetta and some other knights on a rescue mission.
“Madam Rosetta’s magic is ideal for close-quarters combat, making her perfect for this mission. And if Baron Vermilion’s magic can restore her magic just before the battle, she should be able to fight without worrying whether or not her magic will last.”
Of course, the prime minister had no idea Kyle’s magic required having sex. Neither did Rosetta.
“No, um, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” mumbled Kyle.
“Rosetta…doing that with the baron…” stammered Emilia.
But the plan was agreed to without their input.
 
And so Kyle was subjected to an awkward journey in the shaking carriage alone with the knight.
There were four other knights with them, but they were all riding in another carriage.
Intelligence said a group of around 30 dark elves was blocking the road and they claimed Rosetta alone could handle that many.
The elites of the royal guard were having so much trouble because the fortress was out of food and they could not restore their magic.
(But this could be a problem.)
Kyle repeated that phrase to himself for the millionth time.
He still had not explained his recovery magic to Rosetta.
Of course he hadn’t. If he told her his magic required performing a sex act with the subject and had thus stuck his dick inside the princess, she would immediately stab him at least a dozen times with her sword.
He glanced over at her in the opposite seat.
She had fiery red hair, sharp crimson eyes reminiscent of a bird of prey, and a fit body contained in light armor.
The words powerful, reliable, and cool fit her a lot better than cute.
He was certain she could hand his ass to him with ease even without using her magic.
Which was all the more reason not to say anything careless.
But since the entire point of him accompanying her was to prove to her his magic was useful, he would have to explain it to her eventually.
So he would occasionally screw up his courage and start to tell her, but…
“Um, Rosetta?”
“Hmph!”
It was the same every time.
There wasn’t much he could do when she refused to even listen.
(Sigh, I wish I was with the princess right now.)
He ended up reminiscing instead.
 
The night before Kyle left on the rescue mission, he had been given a room in the castle to spend the night.
As a lower noble, he was given the smallest and most out-of-the-way guest room they had, but it had still been nicer than his room at home.
After removing his jacket and preparing to change into his sleeping clothes, a knock came at the door.
“Baron Vermilion, are you still up?”
“Princess!? P-please, come in.”
He threw back on his jacket, cleared his throat, and opened the door.
Emilia hesitantly walked in.
She was wearing a much plainer dress than before. Probably what she normally wore around the castle.
“What brings you here so late at night?”
He took a nonchalant look out the door, but there was no sign of Rosetta or the maid named Claris. She must have come alone.
“Um, well…the thing is…”
She had trouble getting the words out.
She stood there in front of him, fidgeting with her hands clasped in front of her stomach.
When he saw that, he remembered something he had forgotten to tell her.
“By any chance, do you have a funny feeling in your stomach?”
“Y-yes, I do.”
Her eyes widened and she looked up at him, but then she looked away in embarrassment.
“Um…ever since I used my magic, my stomach…no, my jee spot has been throbbing.”
She pressed her knees together and twisted her body in an alluring way.
“I’m sorry, princess, but that is the Sex Mark’s doing.”
“What is that?”
“When I stimulated your magic circuit with my own, it created a link between our circuits. This causes the Sex Mark to appear on your skin near your circuit’s focal point.”
“So…above my jee spot?”
“Yes.”
Hearing her repeatedly say “g-spot” made his heart pound, but he worked to keep it off his face as he continued his explanation.
“If your magic is restored again after the Sex Mark appears, the recovery is more efficient and it can even power up your magic. But…”
“But what?”
“The Sex Mark causes your body to desire my magic.”
“You mean doing that same- no, I don’t need to ask.”
She twisted her body further. She was having trouble even staying standing.
“I already feel a great desire to have your cock stimulate my jee spot. Just like you did before.”
“Princess…”
He took her in his arms without even thinking.
Her body was so soft and shockingly warm in her desire for him.
But he resisted the urge to take her right then and there.
“It would be wrong of me not to be fully forthcoming here, Princess. I can erase the Sex Mark from your body. That would mean severing the connection to my circuit. Then this throbbing in your body would go away.”
“If you did that…could you not restore my magic anymore?”
“I still could. It just wouldn’t have the increased efficiency or magic boosting. But I could do the same recovery as earlier any time.”
“I see…”
She hesitated for a moment, but she sounded sure of herself when she answered.
“That will not be necessary. This throbbing is a sign of our connection. If I focus on that, I believe I can tame it. Oh, but…”
She looked worriedly up at him.
“Would you prefer we sever this connection?”
“Not at all!”
“Ah.”
He could not stop himself from raising his voice and kissing her. But unlike before, this was a soft and gentle kiss.
“Baron Vermilion…”
“Would you please call me Kyle?”
The hands holding her slowly slid downwards.
He pulled up her skirt to reveal her lower stomach. There was indeed a complex pattern there, similar to a dungeon map.
He gave the Sex Mark a rub and it faded away.
“Oh…it’s gone.”
“It isn’t always visible. It appears more vividly the stronger the link between our circuits. Also, it should only be visible to others with a link to my circuit, so you don’t have to worry about someone else seeing it.”
“Eh?”
He was trying to allay her fears, but that last part gave her a strange feeling.
(Is he saying there are other women he’s done this with?)
It was a strange mixture of irritation, sadness, and distress.
But before she could identify it as jealousy, his fingers touched her labia through her underwear.
“Ahh.”
“You’re so wet… You’ve been wanting this pretty badly, haven’t you?”
He slid her panties to the side and pressed his fingers against her soaked vulva. Her labia seemed to suck his fingers inside and then he pushed them inside her vagina.
“Ahh…Baron Vermil- Kyle’s fingers…are inside me!”
Seeing her writhing in embarrassment, he decided to teach her a new dirty word.
“That’s called your pussy. Can you say that?”
“My…pussy?”
“Yes. And what do you want me to do to your pussy?”
“I-I want you to fill my pussy with your cock…a-and then I want you to thrust in and out, pounding it against my jee spot!”
“Your wish is my command.”
After loosening her up with some fingering and getting her to talk dirty, he invited her over to his bed.
He reached for his slacks and was just about to release his rock-hard cock, but…
“Princess! Where are you, Princess!”
“!?”
“!?”
They both froze when they heard a voice out in the hallway.
It was Rosetta.
She must have discovered Emilia was not in her room and went searching for her.
If she found Emilia here with Kyle, she would cut him down on the spot. Emilia must have reached the same conclusion because she hurried out of the bed, fixed her clothing, and faced him.
“I-I will be leaving now.”
“Um, yes.”
She quickly left his room.
The only thing remaining was the faint scent of her love juices hanging in the air. Well, that and his erect cock.
“What am I supposed to do with this now?”
 
He had ended up jerking off three times before it was calm enough for him to get some sleep.
He had departed the following day, so he had only been able to speak a few words with Emilia since. He had not had a chance to touch her with even a fingertip.
He had given her some magic with his fingers, so the effects of the Sex Mark would be more subdued for a while.
But that did nothing to help him.
He grew weirdly embarrassed when he remembered how he had made her say such lewd and out-of-character things.
He had practiced with some women while figuring out how his magic worked, but he was far from well experienced.
Still, he felt like he had done pretty well there.
(If only that stupid knight hadn’t cockblocked us!)
“Hey.”
While he stewed, Rosetta suddenly called out to him. This may have been the first thing she had said to him since they boarded the carriage.
“Yes, what is it?”
“Why are you glaring at me like that? Do you have a problem with me?”
His frustration over not getting to have sex with Emilia must have shown on his face.
But he couldn’t give that as a reason, so he tried to brush it off.
“N-no, it’s nothing. Sorry. I was lost in thought.”
“Hmph,” she snorted. “If you have something to say, come out and say it. And you call yourself a man?”
“Ha…ha ha ha…”
He laughed, but he was seething with anger on the inside.
(Y-you stupid knight. You’ve ignored me every goddamn time I’ve tried to talk to you and now this!?)
He had been trying to avoid an argument since she was Emilia’s knight and best friend, but she had pushed him to his limit.
But the next thing she said erased all thought of that from his mind.
“God…don’t think you can get away with anything just cause you’re hot.”
“Eh?”
She called him hot.
“Um?”
“…Yes?”
“You think I’m hot?”
“Wha-? You’re asking that yourself!?”
His behavior shocked Rosetta, but it was not his fault.
He had grown up out in the countryside, so the only people he ever met her his parents, his servants, and the local farmers. They had all been kind to him for reasons other than his appearance. He had lived a life that left him unaware how his appearance would be judged according to elf beauty standards.
His appearance (by some kind of miracle) had a faint resemblance to his appearance in his previous life. Those more Asian features gave him a rather flat face for an elf.
“This is not about what I think. It’s just that the actors who look like you tend to earn a lot of cheers when they appear on the stage. The general public calls people like you hot, so this is not about what I think!”
After repeating herself for emphasis, she crossed her arms and looked away.
In that case, realized Kyle.
Rosetta may have been worried about him winning over the princess with his good looks, not just his recovery magic.
But more than that, Rosetta was clearly interested in his appearance herself.
(Interesting.)
Then the carriage came to a stop.
One of the knights from the other carriage opened the door.
“Captain Rosetta, we have arrived.”
“Good. Set up camp immediately.”
Rosetta stepped out of the carriage and unloaded their cargo. She gave instructions to the other knights while she worked alongside them to set up a camp in a corner of the forest. She switched modes impressively fast.
There was nothing for Kyle to do.
They were a single mountain away from where the dark elves had blocked the path.
The path took the long way around from here, so it would take another half a day to reach that point, but they could arrive in about an hour by crossing the mountain.
Once they were ready, the attack would begin.
It was not long before their camp was ready. It was really just a tent with some chairs and a table inside. It was very simple since they did not have a large force to command. The horses were removed from the carriages and tied to the trees.
“As planned, I will now have my magic fully restored. Three of you use that time to go scout out the dark elves while one remains here on guard duty.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
They must have been given their individual roles in advance because the knights got to work without further question. Three got their equipment in order and entered the mountain while one short female knight remained behind.
“Um, Rosetta?”
“…Yes?”
“You should probably send her with the others.”
“Why? I don’t know what your recovery magic entails, but we will be at risk without a guard.”
“That’s true, but on the other hand…”
He was having trouble thinking of anything riskier than performing his magic here.
Especially with someone else around.
It certainly didn’t help that the knight who had remained behind looked like a 10-year-old girl.
As an elf, her actual age would be much higher, but it still made things awkward.
“What’s wrong, Baron Vermilion? The scouts will be back in about 2 hours. Aren’t you supposed to fully restore my magic in that time?”
“Um, yes…”
What now?
He would have to explain what his magic entailed eventually, but he had yet to think up a way to make that go smoothly.
But Rosetta interpreted his hesitance differently and grinned.
“Can’t keep up the act any longer, Baron Vermilion? You never did have any recovery magic, did you? I bet you spent every last coin you had to buy a special recovery potion to fake it. And a poor noble like you won’t have a second one. Thus, you cannot restore my magic here. Isn’t that right!?”
“What?”
That one pissed him off.
No potion could do that.
But elf magic was so varied that elves with other specialties could often be very mistaken about what was and wasn’t possible for other specialties.
Still, he could not stand to hear her imply all his long days of work could be replaced with money.
He had put up with her attitude this far because he knew she was only protective of Emilia, but this was the last straw.
“Yep, you caught me.”
But he did not yell at her and leave.
A more enjoyable method had occurred to him.
First she had cockblocked him and Emilia and now she was disrespecting the abilities he had worked so hard to develop. His sexual frustration and anger put him in a more dominating mood than normal.
It also may have been inspired by her calling him “hot” earlier.
He put on a somewhat pathetic voice for her.
“It’s true I can use recovery magic, but it’s a weak power. All it can do is create potions by giving restorative properties to a liquid.”
“Hmph. So I was right.”
“But I really did restore the princess’s magic. See, I stumbled upon a way to create potions with far greater restorative properties. Just one potion and your magic is fully restored. It’s just that the ingredients are extremely expensive and I can’t make very much of it…but I do still have one left.”
“And you were planning to have me take that here?”
“Yes. As you saw with the princess, it has no harmful side effects. So I would appreciate it if you took my potion here.” Kyle gave the knight as earnest a look as he could muster. “The potion is called jizz.”
Needless to say, there was no potion by that name, nor one with that effect.
But it was true Kyle could store his magic in semen more than any other substance. Semen was one of the ingredients to create the next generation, so elf semen naturally included a lot of magic.
And during the carriage ride, he had realized the focal point of Rosetta’s magic circuit was located in her mouth and throat. Her circuit was highly concentrated on that focal point, so he had not needed a more careful inspection like he had with Emilia.
That meant doing dirty things that stimulated her mouth would restore her magic.
“Jizz? I’ve never heard of that potion.”
Rosetta tilted her head and for good reason.
The slang term “jizz” did exist in this world too, but it was not widely known and that went double for elves since they generally had little interest in sex.
It was generally referred to as “semen” or “cum”.
“Probably not. Instead of simply restoring magic, it stores the creator’s magic so it can be transferred to someone else, so I doubt a fighter like you would have much use for it.”
That technically wasn’t a lie. Jizz stored (a male elf’s) magic and transferred it to someone else(’s egg).
But Rosetta didn’t know that extra context and simply nodded in understanding.
“Fine, whatever. Then give me this jizz of yours already. I might as well drink it.”
Her unintentionally dirty phrasing made him grin on the inside while he turned to the short knight on guard duty.
“I will now be restoring Rosetta’s magic, so please wait inside the carriage. Do not spy inside the camp until I am done.”
“If you say so.”
“Wait. Why does she have to leave?” asked Rosetta.
“Um…the thing is, drinking jizz temporarily causes your magic to be emitted from your body. When someone else is nearby, your magics can mix, which interferes with the recovery. I can adjust my own magic, so it isn’t a problem with me.”
“…………Hmph.”
Kyle made up an excuse and Rosetta gave him a suspicious glare, but she ultimately nodded toward the guard knight.
The other knight obediently left for the carriage.
“Is that better? Just let me drink your jizz already.”
Rosetta grumpily repeated that dirty word.
 
With the knight girl in the carriage, Kyle and Rosetta moved inside the tent.
“Now, you take a seat here, Rosetta.”
“Why do I need to sit down to drink a potion?”
Rosetta was as grumpy as ever, but Kyle smiled.
“You sit down for an exam at the hospital, don’t you? This is the same.”
“Something about this doesn’t sit right with me.”
Her warrior’s intuition was excellent indeed, so she glared at him even more.
He could not have her guard go up any further, so he decided to change how he did this.
“Fine. You can remain standing if you want. Just drink this.”
He pulled a small vial out of his bag and handed it to her.
She frowned and viewed the liquid within.
It was colorless, transparent, and somewhat viscous. It did look a bit like the magic recovery potions used by the knights.
“So this is jizz, is it?”
“Yes, it is.”
It was not jizz. It was only a lotion made from boiling the leaves of the lunaweed that grew in the mountain behind his mansion. It was nontoxic, but it had no positive effects if ingested either.
Rosetta opened the vial’s lid and sniffed at it. The uniquely medicinal smell was also similar to the magic recovery potions she knew.
“Please drink it all at once.”
“If you insist…”
She had said she would drink it and she was not one to go back on her word.
She brought the vial to her lips and then drank the contents in one quick swig.
“What…is this?” she got out while nearly choking.
It was a strange liquid. It was somewhat viscous, so she could still feel some of it clinging to her mouth and throat. It also left behind a faintly bitter aftertaste.
It tasted far different from ordinary magic recovery potions.
“So you drank it all?”
“Yes, I did.”
“I see. So you drank my semen.”
“Um…………eh?”
Her mind briefly went blank when she heard that unexpected word coming from his mouth.
She was rendered speechless, so he spoke instead.
“Oh, did I neglect to mention that? Jizz is another term for semen. That potion was made by watering it down.”
“Huhhhhhhhhhhh!?” screamed Rosetta. She used her well-trained abs to produce the voice, so the tent itself nearly shook. “What…you…but…are you insane!? Why would you have me drink s-se- that!?”
“Because it is a potion. Semen contains a lot of magic, after all. The effects should be showing up right about now.”
“What are you- ah!?”
She started to protest further, but then she doubled over. Her hips dropped into the chair she had refused to sit in before.
“Ahhn!? What…? My body…feels so hot. What did you drug me with!?”
Her mouth suddenly grew hot like she had just had some piping-hot milk. That heat spread downwards through her body until it reached her lower stomach.
“Yes, there are those effects I was talking about.”
Kyle let some saliva drip onto his middle and index fingers and then stuck them inside her mouth.
This had worked well.
Her reaction was not from the “potion”.
It was only an experimental lotion that had amused him by how much it resembled semen, but it did not actually have any semen in it.
But thinking she had swallowed his semen had aroused Rosetta and activated her magic circuit.
He poked around in her mouth.
She started to resist with her teeth, but once he stroked a finger along the roof of her mouth, her entire body trembled and she stopped resisting.
The mouth – especially the roof – was ticklish and not even a royal knight had trained against this.
“The jizz has taken effect. This much doesn’t normally cause such a powerful effect, but your body must be especially responsive to it.”
“Thah ih abhurh…ahhh!”
She groaned with his fingers in her mouth and drool dripping from the corner of her mouth.
(He must be lying! I am the princess’s knight! My body would never be so indec- nhhh!?)
She squirmed when she felt a ticklish sensation near her hips.
She looked down to see Kyle removing the hip part of her armor.
“Wh-what are you doing!?”
“You looked like you were suffering, so I thought I would give you some relief.”
“S-suffering? What are you- kh!”
Only then did she notice the wet feeling below her armor and several layers of fabric covering her crotch.
(What!?)
Rosetta would sometimes pleasure herself at night and she would get wet like this then, but she could not believe stimulation inside her mouth had caused it.
Once he got the hip part of her armor off, he reached a hand to the crotch of her clothing.
“Your body is producing love juices in response to my jizz. That proves that your body is perfect for accepting jizz.”
“B-Baron Vermilion! Stop this!”
“Why should I? I’m just checking to see if your magic will recover from drinking jizz.”
“Enough with that! That is not how anything works!”
“Then how do you explain this reaction?”
“Hhh!”
He lightly touched her pussy through her clothes and her hips nearly hopped out of the chair. She had grown unbelievably sensitive.
“This is…o-oh, I know! This is the potion you had me drink! That was actually an aphrodisiac, wasn’t it!? So it was the potion, not my body. This could never be my body!”
“Sorry, but no,” he said with a grin.
He was telling the truth. That lotion had no aphrodisiac effect.
She was so wet because she thought she had swallowed his semen. It had actually been a very semeny lotion and not actual semen, but just thinking she had was enough for her body to react like this.
(Incredible. She might have real talent for cum guzzling.)
With that thought, he stood up in front of her.
“Baron Vermilion! What are you doing!?”
“Preparing more jizz for you, of course.”
He pretended not to know why she was shocked as he pulled down his slacks and underwear, exposing his lower body.
His penis appeared before her eyes.
His arousal was overpowered by nerves about whether or not his payback against her would work, so it was still only partially erect. It was curved a bit upwards while swaying some.
Rosetta’s chair had no back and was low to the ground. It was a lot like the outdoor chairs used for camping or fishing back in modern Japan. And with her hips that low, her head was lower too.
Kyle brought a hand to his penis and moved it right in front of her face.
“Nhh! Get that filthy thing away from me!”
“It’s not filthy. I clean it thoroughly every day.”
“That isn’t what I meant! It’s intrinsically filthy! Dirty! Gross!”
“That’s not a nice thing to say. But you already drank the jizz that came from this dirty and gross thing.”
“Ah…ahh.”
Those words immediately sapped the defiance from her and she started squirming in her seat.
She held her hands to her crotch and trembled like a child needing to pee.
Simply being told she had swallowed semen had inspired arousal in her.
(Is she a lot more of a pervert than she lets on?)
Rosetta had mentioned “the stage” back in the carriage.
It had only been a casual reference, but was it possible she was interested in those sorts of stories?
Kyle concluded she had heard all sorts of stories about sex but had no experience herself and had let her imagination run wild.
Meanwhile, she could not take her eyes off of the penis positioned right in front of her eyes.
(So this is…a man’s sex organ.)
Kyle was correct that she had no sexual experience.
She had been born to a prestigious family of knights, so she had spent all her life training to become a royal knight. She had enjoyed the training and she had wanted to protect Princess Emilia who she had befriended at a young age, so she had never felt a need to focus on anything else.
But when she did need to take a break, she would watch plays or read books. And without even realizing it, she had favored romantic stories – or rather, she used the romance as an excuse to read stories with sex scenes in them.
But elves generally had little interest in sex, so such stories were not common in their royal capital.
That had forced her to use her imagination most of the time.
She had lived for centuries like that.
Her active imagination and the nature of her magic circuit meant the simple act of drinking semen (or thinking she had) was enough to get her soaking wet.
She failed to notice the smile on her face as she stared at Kyle’s penis.
It was the look of a child seeing a delicious-looking treat they had never before had.
“Looks like you want it pretty bad.”
“Ah! Wh-why would I want that weird-looking…filthy…”
She could not even finish her insults for his penis.
“Now, now, don’t be shy. Have a taste.”
He grabbed the back of her head to lower it and then shoved his dick in her mouth.
“Nmghhhhh!?”
Her teeth touched it a bit and his hips jerked back a bit, but she put up no further resistance.
She tried to say something and the movement of her tongue stimulated the head. Her surprise made her breathe more rapidly through her nose and mouth and that tickled at his penis.
The most surprising part was how it felt inside her mouth.
Her sticky saliva had been warmed just right inside her hot mouth and it got all over his penis now that it was in there. It was just as pleasant as climbing under an electric blanket inside a cold room.
He felt an urge to shove his dick all the way down her throat, but that would have been a waste of this opportunity.
Instead, he slowly pulled his hips back to enjoy the entrance of her mouth a little more.
The ridge of the head touched her lips and then half the head slipped out between them. That was when he pushed it halfway back in again.
He continued moving in and out of that shallow area to enjoy the feel of her lips on the head.
His partial erection achieved full erection in no time at all.
“Rosetta, can you hold your lips together a little tighter?”
“Nhh, lihe thih?”
“Yes, yes. Ahh, that’s incredible.”
When she tightened up the entrance, the pleasure rapidly increased. He gradually moved faster and deeper.
(Ngh…he’s thrusting…harder and harder!)
All of Rosetta’s focus was concentrated on the cock moving in and out of her mouth.
She kept her teeth apart to avoid hurting it and pressed her lips together. She knew she had to look extremely silly right now, but she felt no desire to stop.
(Because it feels so good. It’s like my mouth has turned into my pussy!)
She could not explain why, but when Kyle’s penis thrusted inside her mouth, she could almost feel it doing the same to her vagina.
She was a virgin and did not know what it felt like to have a penis in there, but she still felt like this act was identical to sex.
“Oh? Rosetta, why are you playing with yourself down? All I’m doing is restore your magic.”
“Hweh? Whah- hwehhhhhhh!?”
It took him pointing it out for her to notice she had stuck a hand inside her clothing and started fingering herself.
Her middle finger was halfway inside her vagina and rubbing at the flesh inside. And she could not stop even after noticing what she was doing.
(How can this be? Why can’t I just pull my finger out and remove my hand from my clothes? Like this! I said like this!)
Try as she might to stop masturbating, her body refused to listen. Almost like she was being controlled by something.
(That liquid must have done this to me!)
Nothing else made sense. There was no other way that she would accept having this man’s penis in her mouth and even start pleasuring herself over it.
And once she had that excuse for her actions, she stopped resisting them.
Was Kyle lying or not?
Could semen restore magic or not?
Was she in her right mind or not?
All the excuses, facts, and emotions had gotten all mixed up during her short exchange with Kyle, so she threw them all out…and lost control.
She stood from the chair with enough force to knock it backwards, crouched down with her knees apart, and swallowed Kyle’s cock.
“Whoa,” Kyle cried out in surprise. “What’s gotten into you?”
Before, Rosetta had simply accepted it without resistance, but now she was actively swallowing his penis.
She swallowed it deep and held it between her palate and tongue.
It felt so good his penis throbbed just before the tip bumped into the back of her throat.
“Ugh!? Cough, cough!”
That caught her by surprise so she spat out his dick and started coughing.
“Cough, cough, cough! What are you doing, Baron Vermilion!?”
“That one was on you, Rosetta. You’re the one that swallowed it so deep.”
“I-I…”
Remembering what she had just done made her want to die of embarrassment.
But that only lasted a moment. When she saw his penis throbbing in front of her eyes, her rational mind was again overpowered.
“I…will do it right this time.”
“Eh? Whoa.”
She wrapped her arms around his legs and pushed him onto his back.
Then she climbed on top of him and brought her face to his dick.
“What a smell…and it’s so hot. Was that really just inside my mouth?”
“It’s hot because you warmed it in your mouth.”
“Ahhh!”
His comment sent a tremor through her entire body.
(I’m getting it now. She gets off on the situation as much as any physical stimulation.)
She did, after all, have her stimulation point in her mouth, which was not even an erogenous zone. She had to be easily aroused by dirty talk and her imagination.
“Then I’ll make it even hotter. I’ll pleasure your penis with my…mouth pussy until shoots out that jizz potion for me.”
She kissed the very tip like it was some kind of ceremony. When she pulled her lips away, a string of precum connected them to his penis.
She licked that up before running her tongue along the head.
Her saliva made all sorts of naughty, sloppy sounds as her tongue stroked, poked, pushed, and licked the head.
After poking at the tip, she pressed her full tongue against the frenulum so it surrounded the bottom half of the head. After supporting the base with her hand, she shifted her tongue to the shaft and coated the entire length with her drool.
“Kh…hh.”
It took all of Kyle’s willpower to avoid moaning as he watched her doing this.
He was supposed to be getting back at her, so he was a little annoyed that she had suddenly taken over like this.
“Ahm.”
“Kh!”
Without warning, she took the head inside her mouth. Her upper lip stickily stimulated the ridge of the head and her lower lip rubbed at the frenulum.
Then she slowly lowered her head to swallow the shaft as well.
She was holding the base in her hand this time so she could keep it under her control.
The tip touched her palate. She guided it from the hard palate in the front to the soft palate in the back.
“Ahh… Hee, I swahhohed the whohe thinh this hime.”
She looked up at him with obvious pride in her achievement.
But the triumphant look was somewhat undermined by how lewd she looked with her mouth opened wide to accept the thick cock.
Kyle wished he could just admire that look, but that was not an option.
Rosetta squeezed her lips tight and pulled her head back up along the length of his penis. Then she swallowed it all again. From there, she repeated the process.
Back in modern Japan, this was known as a vacuum blowjob. Maybe it was her superior lung capacity or maybe knights even trained their cheek muscles, but she created an impressive amount of suction.
His hips trembled from pleasure so powerful he thought she was going to suck his dick right off of him.
“Ugh, wow, Rosetta, that’s…so good! It feels incredible! Ah, I’m about to cum!”
“Cum? You mean jizz? Your jizz potion is ready?”
“Yes, I’ll shoot it into your mouth so you can drink it straight from the source!”
“Yes! Shoot your jizz in my mouth! Shoot your thick, smelly jizz in mouth!”
The rhythmic motion of her head picked up speed.
She could tell his trembling penis had grown to the bursting point inside her mouth.
To fully enjoy its scorching heat on her tongue, cheeks, palate, and deep in her throat, she moved her head so much she felt like she was rattling her brain in her skull.
For Kyle, the intense but soft sensation raced from his penis to his brain.
Holding it in any longer was simply not possible. He felt the pleasure in his lower body taking control of his mind.
“I’m cumming, I’m cumming! Rosetta, swallow my jizz!”
“Ghhhh!”
A thick liquid erupted into her mouth.
After that initial blast, a further squirt of jizz entered her mouth each time the penis throbbed.
There was too much to fit in her mouth, so it flowed down her throat and out of her lips.
“Ubh, ebh, pwahhh. Oh, no. So much jizz is going to waste.”
Rosetta licked up the semen dripping from his penis, pubic hair, lower stomach, and groin. She used a finger to scoop up what was dripping from the corner of her mouth and brought it right back into her mouth.
“Wow, jizz is so smelly, bitter, and gross. Will this really restore my magic? I find that hard to believe. Nhh…”
“You didn’t have to swallow it all if you were skeptical.” Kyle worked to catch his breath after ejaculating. “It doesn’t taste good and you doubt it will restore your power, yet there you are licking up every last drop. You have a cum fetish, don’t you?”
“Me? A cum fetish? Don’t be ridiculous.”
That wasn’t very convincing when she was currently squeezing his penis from base to tip so she could milk out the last remaining drops and then licking them up as soon as they dripped from the tip.
Kyle observed her using his skill as a mage.
This appeared to have restored about half of her magic. That would normally have fully restored it, but her overall amount of magic was higher than average.
(We’ll just have to go another round.)
She would not stop messing with his penis, so he grabbed her shoulders and stood her up. He also got up from the ground himself.
“Done already? But my magic isn’t fully restored.”
“But it is partially restored, right? That was my jizz’s doing.”
“Hm…th-then your semen really does restore magic.”
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.”
She coughed a bit as some semen caught in her throat, so he smiled a bit before speaking.
“This is only to restore your magic, so why are you so wet down there? Not to mention that you’re not wearing anything down there.”
“Eh? Hyahhhhhh!?”
She hadn’t noticed until he pointed it out.
She was currently bottomless and her pussy was so wet the love juices were dripping to the ground.
“Rosetta. You stripped off your bottom so you could finger yourself while sucking my dick, didn’t you?”
“N-no…I…this is all because of that weird potion you gave me!”
“That was just a lubricant. It had no medicinal effects. It didn’t even have any semen in it.”
“Liar! If you hadn’t done something to me, I wouldn’t be like this!”
“Just accept it already.”
Kyle grabbed her shoulders and pushed her back onto the table. She could not find the strength to resist, so she ended up lying face up on the table.
“Accept that you’re a pervert who got turned on just thinking you had swallowed some semen. Accept that you’re a naughty knight who stuck a cock inside her own mouth pussy and milked it of every last drop of cum all while fingering her own pussy.”
“Ahhhh! N-no. I’m not that kind of- hyahhh!?”
She was visibly trembling as the lewd accusations sent waves of pleasure through her body, but she still tried to deny it. Then he got to work removing her armor.
“S-stop! I am…a royal knight…of Finegard! I can’t be doing this…in the middle of camp…during a mission!”
She protested, but she still did not resist.
He soon had her topless as well as bottomless, both her breasts jiggling out into view.
“God, you’ve got some big tits.”
“Uhh…”
Rosetta tearfully covered her breasts with her hands. The rest of her body was so muscular, but her breasts were big and fat. That imbalance made them all the more attractive.
He had left the armor parts on her arms and legs while stripping her torso nude, increasing the eroticism of the view. Rosetta herself seemed aroused by being stripped on the job, the slit below her red pubic hair twitching and dripping with love juices.
Seeing that dignified knight like this put Kyle in a dominating mood.
He had figured out that she was a masochist, so it aroused her more when he was more forceful with her. That would help restore her magic (or so he told himself as an excuse), so he picked her up.
“Rosetta, let’s move over here.”
He placed her on top of the table. The knight was his to do with as he pleased on the table she would normally use to unfurl a map and plan out missions.
He had her lie on her back with just her head sticking off the table.
“Wait, what are you doing now? This is- nghhhhh!?”
He held her cheeks to tilt her head back and then shoved his dick in her mouth.
She had not seen this coming at all, so she groaned loud with eyes wide and pushed at his legs to pull his penis out.
He grabbed her arms and forced them back on top of her body. Then he brought them down toward her crotch.
“Your hands go there. You can finger your pussy as much as you want to enjoy this to the fullest.”
“Nghhhhh!?”
She tried to argue but could not. She had enough trouble breathing that tears flowed from her eyes.
(Th-this is too much! My head…my head feels like it’s going to come off and that thing is sticking even deeper down my throat than before.)
This was nothing like when she was sitting in the chair or when she was lying on top of him. This was the same penis as before, but it felt so much thicker and longer as it violated her mouth.
The head scraped at her palate and the powerful scent passed through her throat to her nose. She wanted to cough, but the penis blocked up her throat and kept her from getting much breath out.
Only lewdly muffled moans managed to escape her mouth.
Also, he was holding her head between his hands.
One hand was placed from her cheek to her chin and throat. The other parted her hair to settle on the back of her head. He held her head tight, preventing her from moving it.
(H-he’s treating me like a sex toy.)
It reminded her of a sex scene like that in a book she had once read.
And as soon as she viewed herself in that light…
(Eh? What?)
She felt powerful anger, but she also felt a trembling spread across her entire body.
She could not resist and she was forced into an uncomfortable position while he shoved his cock in her mouth and began thrusting even though it was suffocating her. It should have been painful, yet she didn’t want it to stop.
Her pussy grew even wetter, her vaginal entrance twitched in its desire for a cock, and something deep inside her belly throbbed. Yet he had told her to use her own hands to pleasure herself.
Every time she remembered it was her this was happening to, pleasure exploded in her brain.
(I am…a royal knight! I would never enjoy having a cock shoved into my mouth to use it like a pussy! This is humiliating!)
The more she tried to deny it, the more her reasons for denying it fueled that very pleasure.
(Ahn, ahh! His cock is pushing deep into my throat! I can’t breathe…but it feels so good!)
She responded to the violation of her mouth by working at her pussy with both hands.
She spread her legs as wide as a woman giving birth, rubbed her clitoris with her right hand, stuck her left hand’s middle finger into her vagina, and stirred it up inside. She was flooded with love juices, giving it all a very wet sound.
(Wow, she’s more of a masochist than I thought.)
Kyle noted that while enjoying how her mouth felt.
He had no way of knowing that her sexual tastes had been formed by the twisted knowledge of the books she had read during the otherwise strict life of a knight.
But he had discovered you had to push past her outer shell in order to unleash the lust hidden underneath. And she was especially turned on by oral techniques like blowjobs and deepthroating.
(I mean, she can barely breathe, but her magic is growing like crazy.)
He pulled his penis out of her mouth to give her a break.
Frothy saliva clung to her lips and she panted with her tongue hung out like a dog on a hot day.
Her chest heaved like a track runner after a long sprint, her large breasts jiggling with each breath.
The nipples were hard and pointed straight up toward heaven, so Kyle pinched them somewhat roughly, but not so strong it would hurt.
“Ahhh, wait,” she said weakly.
But he ignored that and fondled her breasts. He enjoyed the marshmallow-soft sensation and spoke to her.
“What do you want to do last?”
“Last?”
“Yes. The scouts should be back soon, so we only have time for one more thing. I’m letting you choose what that is,” he explained. “So do you want me to continue roughly fucking your mouth pussy until I blow my load down your throat, or do you want me to put it in your wet pussy and gently pleasure you there?”
His question confused Rosetta.
Of course she wanted the gentle one. This had been too rough for her. Why would she ever want to be pinned down while she suffocated on a cock being shoved down her throat?
Her upside-down vision focused in on Kyle’s erect penis.
How could she ever survive if that long, thick thing went down her throat again? And if it ejaculated while her head was upside down like this, wouldn’t she drown on his cum?
So her answer was obvious.
“More of this! Sh-shove that hot and smelly cock down my throat! Fuck my mouth pussy until…until you shoot all that thick cum into my mouth! Down my throat! Into my stomach! And keep cumming until I drown on it♥♥♥ That’s what you want to do, right, you pervert? ♥♥♥”
“Don’t pin your perverted desires on me.”
He no longer cared about getting back at her. He wasn’t mad at her anymore.
He was only interested in satisfying that melted look of unmitigated horniness on her face, so he pushed his penis toward her mouth once more.
She stuck out her tongue to greet it, licking and poking at the head. Her tongue crawled along it like a snake while it continued on past her lips.
(Yes! Cock! In my mouth pussy! This stench…oh, it’s overwhelming…but I don’t want him to stop! I want him to keep going until he cums!)
The very thought of his semen exploding down her throat sent a tremor through her body and her hands reached toward her pussy. When she pushed a couple of fingers into her vagina, she imagined his penis was entering her there too.
She imagined that there were two Kyles here and they were fucking her mouth pussy and her pussy pussy at the same time. The fantasy amplified the pleasure even further.
(Teaming up on me? But not even a royal knight can win two-against-one. You’ll just overpower me and have your way with me, won’t you? Ahhhhh!?)
She felt like her brain itself was being fucked and she had trouble telling her fantasy from reality.
Kyle started moving her head in time with his thrusting.
She was entirely overwhelmed at first, but before long she was moving her tongue and lips in time with the movement. She would occasionally slurp up some saliva, but there was far too much of it and it kept dripping out of her mouth.
The dripping saliva got in her nose, making it even harder to breathe, but Kyle’s penis never stopped moving.
(You’re a monster who only cares about his own pleasure, aren’t you?♥ And I’m entirely at your mercy♥ Your fucking both my pussies at once♥ And you don’t care what happens to me♥♥♥)
She shoved her fingers inside her pussy and stirred it up even more, but in her mind, that was Kyle’s penis too.
(I can’t breathe♥ I need him to cum and end this♥ So I have no choice♥ No choice but to pleasure his cock♥ And make him cum♥♥♥)
When that excuse occurred to her, she happily tightened her lips around his dick.
Her tightened lips could clearly feel the shape of his penis as it thrusted in and out.
He would stop pulling out when her lips reached the narrower part just before the head. But then he would push it back in, the thicker shaft spreading her lips further. She could even feel the locations of the bulging veins.
“Oh, fuck! That’s incredible, Rosetta! I love it! Your mouth was made for sucking dick.”
“Mghhhh!”
(My mouth was not made for sucking dick! That’s ridiculous!)
She denied it, but the thought turned her on even more.
And once she started thinking her mouth existed solely to pleasure cocks, she couldn’t think of it any other way.
Why did she have a tongue if not to crawl all over the big, fat man meat violating her mouth?
Why did she have lips if not to squeeze at the erection thrusting between them?
Why did she have a throat if not to hold a cock as tightly as any vagina?
“Ahh, yes, this is incredible! I’m shoving my dick down your throat, but your face is all melted and you’re sucking it yourself! You’re hornier than I ever imagined! You’ve gotta be the horniest knight in the kingdom!”
“Ngh! Nghhhhh!”
She tried to protest his assessment, but her mouth instead sucked his cock even harder while her fingers stirred up her pussy even harder.
And a strange symbol appeared on her cheek.
The complex shape reminiscent of a dungeon map was the Sex Mark that indicated their magic circuits had been linked.
“I-I’m about to cum! I’ve got a ton of cum ready to flood the mouth of pussy of this horny royal knight who prefers to be roughly deepthroated than to have some normal, gentle sex!”
Her body twisted as if to protest, but her mouth kept on sucking.

The heat, softness, and tight squeezing of her mouth stimulated Kyle’s penis.
“Ah, kh!”
“Nghhhh!”
(Yes❤ Cum❤ Thick cum❤ Sticky cum❤ Smelly cum❤ Bitter cum❤ And it keeps shooting out❤❤❤)
As soon as his penis throbbed and swelled out even more, Rosetta swallowed its full length down her throat.
She ignored the gag reflex trying to get her to spit it back out and she refused to let it go.
The well-trained neck muscles of a knight supported her head in a pose most people could not have maintained for so long.
“Nghghghghghhhh!”
(My throat❤ It’s shooting down my throat❤ There’s so much of it♥ It’s all going down my esophagus to my stomach♥ So much cum, cum, cuuuum♥♥♥)
Now he was violating her all the way down the throat and into her stomach.
That thought pushed her body over the edge.
A fluid less thick than her love juices erupted from her pussy.
It sprayed out like a fountain, soaking the table and the ground beyond it.
“Incredible. You just squirted, Rosetta.”
“Agh, ghhhhn!”
Kyle gradually pulled his penis out. He was still ejaculating, so the milky stuff shot out of the trembling tip to fill her mouth.
Finally, the tip emerged from between her lips.
When Rosetta saw its full length coated with her saliva and his semen, her body went limp.
She tried to breathe, but she only ended up forming bubbles in the semen filling her mouth, like she was gargling it. And her nose was blocked up by her own drool and snot.
“Nh, gulp, gulp.”
She had no choice but to shut her mouth and swallow all of the semen.
The milky fluid caught in her throat and still kept her from breathing, so she quickly sat up on the table and resumed swallowing with gravity on her side this time.
Kyle panicked when he saw this.
(Shit, I may have gone too far.)
He had pushed things further and further since she never stopped him.
He had honestly not needed to go this far to fully restore her magic.
He couldn’t forget that she thought he was good looking but generally disliked him. She might just kill him right here in the tent after this.
“U-um, Rosetta? Are you okay?”
“Cough, cough. Ugh, how was there so much of it!? There must be something wrong with your body!”
“Sorry. I use a potion and a special diet to increase my semen production since it’s necessary for my magic.”
“I can’t believe you.”
She glared at him while climbing down from the table.
Her eyes were focused on his still-erect penis.
(I-is she going to cut it off!?)
Kyle felt the most fundamental male fear.
He considered calling for the knight girl waiting in the carriage, but then Rosetta kneeled in front of him.
“W-won’t it get your clothes dirty if it’s this filthy?”
“Eh?”
It was true his penis was sticky with her saliva and his semen.
“A-a pervert like you is going to demand I lick it clean, aren’t you?”
She looked up at him with the hopeful look of a puppy wanting its owner to play.
His worries about taking it too far had been unfounded.
He grabbed his dick by the base and slapped her face with it a few times.
“You’ve got that right, mouth slut. Oral sex isn’t over until you’ve cleaned it with your tongue.”
His dirty words and the dick slaps sent another tremor of pleasure through her body and she quickly got to work running her tongue along his messy cock.
 
“Spirits, hear my call. My name is Rosetta, the one bound to you by contract.
“Spirits, gather here and grant me your power. My name is Rosetta, the one who wishes to seed her fire power.
“Spirits, Rosetta seeks your power, so please grant it!”
 
The spirit magic incantation was answered with fire entering the blade of Rosetta’s sword.
She raised the blazing flame sword overhead, jumped down from the top of a cliff, and attacked the dark elves blocking the mountain road.
“Hahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”
“What!?”
“We’re under attack! We’re under- gwahhhhh!”
“It’s just one knight! Don’t let her scare- wahhhh!”
The dark elf resistance was easily overcome and Rosetta neutralized her opponents.
 
The scouts had returned about 15 minutes after Rosetta had licked Kyle’s penis clean.
Rosetta had set off into the mountains and attacked as soon as she had their information on the location and number of the dark elves.
By the time Kyle and the other knights caught up in the carriages, all 30-odd dark elves had been neutralized.
With that, the fortress full of an elite royal guard unit was safely liberated.
 
As a side note, the knight girl who had remained as a guard during Rosetta’s magic recovery had gone and waited in the carriage as Kyle asked, but when she heard Rosetta shouting, she had grown worried, peeked inside the tent, and watched every last thing Kyle and Rosetta had done together.
That experience would go on to greatly influence her sex life in the future, but that is a story for another day.

Elf Harem Chapter 3: The Princess On Top – I Want You to Enjoy it Too❤
“I’m about to cum, Rosetta! Open your mouth wider and stick out your tongue.”
“Like this?♥”
“Yes, perfect. Ah, I-I’m cumming! Kh.”
“Yes, finally❤ Ahn❤ There’s so much of it❤ It’s all over my face❤ And my hair will get all sticky too❤ I’ll just have to swallow it instead❤ Ahm❤❤ Nh, nh, nh❤❤❤”
Kyle was standing with his back against the wall and Rosetta was kneeling in front of him with his cock in her mouth.
She only released it after sucking out every last drop of semen.
They were in a hallway of a detached section of the royal palace given to Kyle.
Technically, he was only using one of its rooms, but since the other rooms were vacant, it was effectively his house.
A few days had passed since they returned from the rescue operation.
After eating dinner, he had returned to his room to find Rosetta in front of the door.
Without so much as a “good evening”, she had pulled down his pants and started sucking his dick.
“Why am I so compelled to keep doing this? I blame your recovery magic and that Sex Mark!”
“And I’ve explained over and over that I can remove that.”
He had already explained the details of his recovery magic to her. Including that the connection to his magic circuit could be severed if he removed the Sex Mark.
But she had never told him to do so. That meant the complicated pattern was still visible on her cheek.
Of course, only she, Kyle, and Emilia, who was also linked to his magic circuit, could see it.
She claimed this was a sacrifice she was making to give her the strength she needed to protect the princess.
Yet she was constantly complaining to him that the Sex Mark was always throbbing and her craving for semen was so powerful it distracted her from her duties.
Kyle could tell that was not the Sex Mark’s doing, but he let her think what she wanted since boosting her magic would indeed help her in the fight against the dark elves.
Unfortunately, he could not have her suck his dick all night long. He was supposed to go visit Emilia.
But when he tried to pull up his pants, Rosetta grabbed his hand to stop him.
“Um…Rosetta?”
“The thing is… my body still feels funny.”
“Funny how?”
“I didn’t get enough cum- no, wait! I, uh, mean…it’s the Sex Mark! Are you sure that thing isn’t addictive? The effects keep getting worse and sucking you off once isn’t enough to satisfy it anymore.”
“No, it doesn’t do anything like that.”
“Liar! How else can you explain this wetness down here…and this longing?”
She pulled down her underwear and brought a hand to her pussy.
He could hear sticky sounds coming from there.
“What am I supposed to do about this?”
She held up her hand to show him the sticky love juices forming a string between her fingers and her pussy.
“Hm, I see.”
Kyle understood now.
Rosetta loved oral so much she could get wet and even cum just from giving a blowjob. Sucking a dick was enough to get her juices flowing, but she needed something more extreme to achieve orgasm.
“So do you want me to fuck your throat again?”
“N-no, I don’t.”
But this time, she shook her head and blushed before explaining.
“I, um, want it…in here.”
“You mean in your pussy?”
“P-pu- you don’t have to say it out loud!” she shouted, hiding her face against the wall.
(Damn, she’s cute.)
Kyle was excited by this unexpected side of the knight.
It made sense. She may have been an oral-loving freak, but she had always experienced romance vicariously through plays or storybooks. She would of course want to have normal sex too.
“Yes, that can be arranged.”
“Ahn!”
He grabbed her hips from behind.
It was weirdly arousing to see her with all her armor on her upper body and below her knees, but nothing covering anything in between.
He pressed his penis against her butt.
He rubbed it down along her labia, eliciting a pathetic cry from her.
“Wh-what are you doing!?”
“What do you mean? I haven’t even put it in yet.”
“Oh, I-I see…”
“Okay, here goes.”
“B-bring it on!”
“This isn’t a sparring match, Miss Knight.”
He smiled bitterly and she waved a hand in protest.
“I-I can’t help it! Unlike you, I don’t think about sex every second of the day!”
“So you say, but this dripping pussy says otherwise.”
He pushed his hips forward and his penis entered her vagina with no resistance at all.
“Hyaaaagh!?”
She raised her voice because it felt like having something stuffed inside all the excess space within her body.
He felt something tearing on the way inside. He had broken her hymen.
“Did that hurt?”
“Th-this is nothing compared to when I broke my arm in training.”
“I should certainly hope so.”
He smiled bitterly again when she compared this to combat.
He had gained a fair bit of sexual experience when training his recovery magic, but that did not mean he was particularly good at interacting with women.
But he strangely felt an urge to take the lead here when he saw Rosetta’s awkward behavior.
“If it’s too much for you, just tell me.”
“S-sure…that’s unusually nice of you.”
“It’s the least I can do.”
With that, he began moving his hips back and forth.
“I see. The least you can do, is it?”
Rosetta felt the thick thing moving inside her.
His penis rubbed against her vaginal walls.
The thing she had held in her mouth countless times over the past few days was now moving inside the bottom of her stomach.
“Ah, hh, that’s…so good. I love it…when you rub against…that wall there!”
She had learned the shape of his penis so well with her lips, tongue, and mouth that she could tell exactly which part of it was stimulating her vagina.
The swollen head was pressing against the walls. The shaft was spreading her labia. The very tip was kissing the entrance to her womb whenever it pushed deep inside.
“Ahhh, Kyle, more! Deeper! Yes, there! With the tip! Knock on my womb’s door!”
“Huh, I guess this mouth likes cock just as much as the one on your face.”
He could tell her womb was lowering to return his penis’s kisses.
He thrusted up with his hips to pound on her womb’s entrance enough to feel its shape.
“Ah, yes, there! More, more!”
She was shouting, but it sounded like this wasn’t enough for her.
Struck by a flash of insight, he placed a hand on her head and turned it about halfway around.
“Hm? What are you doing, Kyle?”
“I see.” It all made sense now. “Rosetta, you just won’t be satisfied without something in your mouth, will you?”
“Huh!? Th-that’s crazy talk.”
“The longing look on your face tells a different story.”
“No, I don’t- gh!?”
Before she could make her excuses, he stuck his index finger in her mouth.
“Now face forward again.”
“Ghh, mgh!”
She tried to protest, but he stuck his middle and ring finger in as well.
Her vagina squeezed his dick in response.
“See, I was right. Your pussy squeezed when I stuck my fingers in there.”
“H-ho, hih’s hoh hrue.”
“I can’t understand a word you’re saying!”
He stuck his thumb and little finger in as well. All five fingers wriggled like tentacles to grab her tongue, stimulate the back of her gums, and rub the roof of her mouth.
“Ah, gh, hweh, slurrrrp❤”
Her groans were interspersed with slurping sounds as her saliva tried to escape.
He resumed thrusting his hips and also pumped his hand in and out of her mouth.
“Ah, nh, nh, nh, nh, nh.”
￼
She immediately tangled her tongue with his fingers and moved her own head back and forth.
(Oh, wow. I love this.)
She shut her eyes.
This felt entirely different from when he had fucked her in the mouth while she fingered her pussy yesterday.
She could feel his warmth above and below. He was attacking both of her holes right now.
“Ah, yes…your pussy is moving like crazy. It feels so damn good. Ah, I’m going to cum…”
“Gh! Then cum♥ Cum in my lower mouth❤❤ Fill me with all your tasty cum! ❤❤❤❤❤”
She almost sounded angry, but she also wiggled her ass.
He pounded his hips against that ass and then released all his semen.
“Ahhhhhhh! ❤❤❤❤❤”
He pulled his fingers from her mouth and a ton of saliva dripped out.
“Ahh, yes, yessssssss❤❤ Your cock is trembling in my pussy❤❤ It’s shooting out so much cum❤❤❤❤❤”
She shouted while her body trembled.
The same thick semen that had always exploded into her mouth was now pumped into the deepest part of her body. It soaked into her from within.
“Ahh…khh❤ Hh❤❤”
She felt like he was permeating every part of her body as she went limp and collapsed onto the floor.
His penis slipped out of her vagina.
“A-are you okay?” he asked in slight surprise.
His voice brought her back to her senses.
She had her knight training to thank for that abnormally quick recovery.
“H-hmph. That was okay, I guess. But don’t think you’ve won.”
“It’s not a competition, you know.”
He was exasperated, but she had her clothing and armor back on in a flash and was preparing to leave.
But then she turned around.
“Baron Vermilion, will you be visiting the princess now?”
“Yes. She asked me to dinner, remember?”
“I do…”
She groaned quietly like his answer displeased her.
“Are you jealous?”
“Huh!? Don’t be silly! I don’t care about you one way or the other! I am only here because of that stupid Sex Mark and I have no feelings for you whatsoever!”
She shouted it all in a single breath and then actually left this time.
She stomped away with such force he was afraid she would break the floor tiles.
He scratched his cheek while watching her go.
“Well, she’s not hard to read.”
 
Ten minutes later, Kyle arrived at Emilia’s bedroom just like he had told Rosetta he would.
He had changed clothes and washed up first. Not only had he ejaculated twice, but he couldn’t show the princess his dick when it was covered with Rosetta’s saliva and love juices.
“Princess, it’s Kyle.”
“C-come in.”
When he knocked and announced his presence, he received a nervous response.
“Excuse me.”
He opened the door and entered.
Before seeing Emilia seated in the chair by the bed, he saw a maid standing right in front of the door. She must have been on her way out.
“Oops. Sorry, Claris.”
He stepped aside to let her pass.
“Excuse me.”
The green-haired, green-eyed maid bowed quickly and left.
She was Emilia’s personal maid and Kyle had barely spoken with her. This may have been his first time hearing her speak since they first met.
(Does she know what I’m doing with the princess?)
Kyle couldn’t help but wonder.
So far, he had only explained the details of his recovery magic to Emilia and Rosetta. To everyone else, he had simply said it used a “fairly special method”.
But that maid was the one who made Emilia’s bed, so she could have easily noticed something.
Emilia said she had served her since she was young, just like Rosetta had, so she was unlikely to spread any of Emilia’s secrets. Perhaps it would be better to tell her now instead of letting her wonder.
“Is something wrong, Kyle?”
“No, no.”
Emilia’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts.
He faced her and spoke.
“Now then, princess. Let’s boost your magic.”
 
Emilia had decided to boost her magic during dinner today.
The interrogation of the dark elves Rosetta had captured had revealed yesterday that they were planning to send in a small group to infiltrate the capital.
The capital had a few belltowers that would ring on the hour. The plan was to take control of those and use those elevated positions to launch a magical attack on the castle.
But the capital was a city of commerce, so the castle town was a crowded place. The dark elf infiltrators might not be found right away, so the task would require moving a large number of guards from their usual duties.
The guard unit that returned the other day had now taken up position to protect the capital from that external threat. They could not protect just the castle.
That meant defenses of the castle itself would be understaffed.
Which was why Kyle had suggested that Emilia boost her magic.
 
“I explained this at dinner, but I would like to go over it again before we begin.”
They were sitting side by side on the bed like lovers or a married couple.
“Your lightning magic is powerful enough to win a battle in a single strike. It is certainly impressive, but you said you have trouble making smaller attacks, right? In other words, you can’t restrain your magic enough to weaken the lightning strike or shape it in whatever form you like.”
“Yes, that is true.”
“We can fix that tonight. By gradually filling your magic circuit with small amounts of magic, your body can learn what it feels like to have small amounts of magic flowing through it. Then you should be able to launch lightning strikes to protect the castle.”
In modern Japanese terms, Emilia was like a heater stuck on full blast. It was powerful, but the room would quickly grow too hot and it would eat up a lot of power.
So they were going to add a power adjustment knob. With a “low” and “medium” mode, she could avoid wasting so much power.
“What exactly am I supposed to do?” she asked.
“We need to get your orgasms lasting as long as possible.”
“They can last longer?” she asked, tilting her head.
“They can be longer and more powerful.”
“Oh…”
She blushed and lowered her head at the thought of something more powerful than what she had experienced the other day.
Kyle gave a simple explanation.
“There are three main forms of female orgasm, each associated with a part of body: clitoris, g-spot, and cervix. I will use magic to stimulate those three locations. The intermittent stimulation should lead to a longer orgasm made up of multiple waves.”
“Clitoris, jee spot, cervix…it sounds like a very naughty magic spell.”
“They are magical, if you ask me.”
“Ah…”
He kissed her.
He carried saliva into her mouth on his tongue, which she accepted without any resistance.
She swallowed the saliva and then their lips separated.
“I notice you aren’t resisting it tonight.”
“Th-that was your fault. Anyone would be surprised when someone does that without any warning.”
“And does that surprise get you wet down here?”
“Hyah!” she shrieked when he suddenly touched her crotch.
“Kyle, this is…embarrassing.”
“You accepted my fingers and cock just fine the other day.”
“Only because…the dark elves were approaching. It was a crisis!”
He pressed down on her skirt to stimulate her labia and she tried to pull his arm away.
He wasn’t going to go along with that, so he ignored it and continued teasing the princess’s pussy.
“That crisis hasn’t ended. The dark elves could be anywhere in the capital. They might be searching out an opening to attack the castle right this very moment. They might launch their attack as soon as tomorrow. And boosting your magic is the only way to defend against it.”
His argument convinced her to stop pulling on his arm.
“Y-you’re right. This is a crisis, so I can’t afford to hesitate.”
Emilia could be very shy, but when she was given a justification, she could switch her embarrassment off.
He had learned that when he had restored her magic last time.
“Princess, I am afraid I must ask you to lift your skirt.”
“…Understood.”
She grabbed the hem of her skirt and lifted the draped cloth, revealing her legs in white socks.
Her slender thighs were a milky color almost as white as the socks.
Past that, she wore lacy white underwear.
Kyle reached in and removed that underwear.
“Wow, you’re so wet there are strings between your underwear and here.”
“Please don’t say that out loud…”
She twisted in embarrassment and tried to close her legs, but he pushed them wider with his hands.
The princess was now seated on the bed with her thighs spread wide. Kyle kneeled on the floor and move between her legs.
From the side and from a distance, it would have looked a lot like a faithful servant kneeling before his seated queen. Except he was much too close to her.
He held her thighs in place, lowered his head, and kissed her pussy lips.
“Ahn!? Kyle, wh-what are you doing?”
Her body tensed at the soft and warm sensation. She even let go of her skirt in surprise.
“Princess, please hold onto your skirt. You don’t want it to get dirty, do you?”
“N-no. Sorry.”
She quickly lifted her skirt back up.
The idea of removing it altogether apparently didn’t occur to her.
She was wearing all her usual clothes and even had her legs covered by her socks, but her pussy was exposed to the open air and to Kyle’s gaze. The underwear that would normally cover it up was hanging uselessly from her ankle.
Also, she was spreading her legs as if to show it off and Kyle was positioned between those legs.
She was even lifting her skirt herself.
She could have resisted when he kissed her there, but she did not.
(This is for the good of the kingdom. I know that, but…)
She felt more like she was the one asking Kyle to do this to her, which made her blush bright.
“Ah, hyah!?”
She cried out when a tingling sensation suddenly spread from her pussy to the core of her body.
His lips had touched the small bump at the very top of her vulva.
He only pushed lightly, but her legs still went limp.
“Princess, I assume you and your clitoris are already well acquainted.”
“Yes…we are.”
“Good. Let’s start by bringing you to a light orgasm here.”
With that, he used his tongue to lick at her clit.
The clitoris and its hood felt like they were surrounded by something soft and wet and Emilia’s mind became wrapped in fog.
The sensation was similar to cumming, but it was calmer and softer.
It was a gentle thing instead of slamming her with an intense wave of pleasure.
“Ahh…Kyle, that feels wonderful.”
Her voice sounded weak and she couldn’t remain upright, collapsing back onto the bed. She lay on her back with her legs spread to allow Kyle to continue performing oral sex on her.
He continued using his tongue to stimulate her clitoris.
Her clit was very small. It was only the size of a small bean, so bringing it to orgasm would require patiently stimulating it for a while.
But while he worked at it, the clitoris did grow some.
Once he felt that, he removed his mouth, placed his left hand’s index and middle finger on the hood and the surrounding skin, and spread them to expose the clit. The round thing glistened with his saliva and her love juices while he grabbed it between his right hand’s thumb and index finger.
“Ahhhhn!”
Her hips pulled back in surprise, but he did not stop his fingers.
“You can’t run away from this, princess. Please accept the stimulation. Just relax and let the pleasure wash over you.”
“O-okay…ahhn!”
She nodded, but her hips kept trembling every time he rubbed her clit.
She could feel the pleasure bursting from that small organ.
It was so powerful it scared her.
She wondered if this would lead to one of those longer, more powerful orgasms he had been talking about.
“Princess.”
But then the stimulation stopped and he called out to her.
Anxiety hit her as she feared she had failed somehow. Did she have a defective body that could not cum from the clitoris the way he wanted?
But he gave her a gentle smile when he spoke.
“I apologize. That appears to have been too powerful. This time, I want you to seek out the pleasure at your own pace.”
“Eh?”
Before she could wonder what that meant, he lifted her up and moved behind her like he was embracing her from behind.
He took the hem of her skirt from her and lifted it to her lips.
“Hold this in your mouth.”
“O-okay.”
She wasn’t sure why he wanted that, but she did it anyway.
He then guided her empty hands toward her crotch.
“You’ve done this before, I assume? Focus on the clitoris and stimulate it however you like best.”
“Ah…”
She finally realized what he was asking for.
He wanted her to masturbate with her clitoris.
But she could never do something so embarrassing while he was watching.
Or so she thought. The next thing she knew, her hands were touching herself down there.
“Spread the surrounding skin with her left hand’s fingers. Yes, like that. Now your clitoris is sticking out for you to touch, so do that with your right hand. How you do that is up to you.”
“Okay…nhh!”
The instant she poked it with her index finger, her hips jerked below her.
She was the one touching it now, but it still felt so much better than usual.
And now she was the one in control of supplying that pleasure.
She could not resist the desire, so she gently rubbed her clit with her finger.
“Ahhh…nh, khhhhhhh!”
Once she started, she couldn’t stop.
She stimulated it with both the soft part of her finger and the harder joint. Each touch sent a new wave of pleasure across her body.
“Ahh! Ah, ah, ahn, ahhh, this is…incredible!”
The skirt fell from her mouth and Kyle caught it.
He was not even guiding her hands for her. She was spreading her pussy and teasing her clitoris to pleasure herself all on her own.
“Wow. I’m just rubbing…my clit a little…but it feels unbelievably good!”
“Of course it does. No part of the female body provides more pleasure. Now let that pleasure take over, okay?”
“Okay…yes, yes! It’s never felt this good…doing it on my own before! Ah, ah, ah, ahhhhhhh!”
She finished herself off by squishing the clit down and vigorously rubbing her finger up and down.
A wave of pleasure spread out across her entire body.
“Pant, pant…was that enough of an orgasm for you?”
“Yes. You did well, princess.”
The wave had been weaker than the other day, but it had been greater than when she normally pleasured herself.
Her clitoris throbbed and felt like her finger was still rubbing it.
She concluded that clit orgasms were smaller but more continuous.
“Um…what should I do next?” she asked, sounding worried.
“The rest is a little trickier, so I will provide the stimulation. Next up is the g-spot.”
“The jee spot…”
A tremor ran through her body when that term reminded her of the pleasure from the other day.
She felt a squeezing deep in her stomach.
“Princess, please stand up.”
“Hm? Okay.”
She got down from the bed, wondering what he was going to do.
“Now place your hands on the bed and stick your butt out toward me.”
“Okay…w-wait, what kind of pose is that!?”
“Your g-spot is fairly deep inside, so I believe that is the best position to reach it.”
“I…see.”
She accepted that answer, but that didn’t make it any less embarrassing.
He casually moved behind her and placed his arms around on her stomach.
“Hyah, ahn!”
She pitched forward and had to place her hands on the bed to catch herself.
She ended up in the exact pose he had requested.
“This is so embarrassing…ah.”
She tried to move her hips forward, but he had them solidly in his grip and held them in place.
“Um, Kyle…this is embarrassing.”
“But your pussy is so wet its juices are dripping down your legs. I can only imagine it wants to be penetrated as soon as possible.”
“Ahh…don’t say that.”
He reached his hand around and spread her labia, revealing the vagina within.
Viewed from behind, this pose did indeed make her look very lewd.
Her dress’s skirt was lifted to reveal her bare butt.
Thanks to cumming earlier, her legs were shaking in their socks.
She had taken the doggy style position, but elves had relatively little interest in sex and rarely used alternate positions like this.
But it was true this was the best position for stimulating her g-spot.
“Okay, I’m going to put it in, princess.”
“You mean put your cock inside my pussy?”
“Yes. Just like before.”
He removed his slacks and underwear and supported his erection in his hand. He pressed the tip against her crevice.
“Ahn.”
She moaned quietly since the previous orgasm had left her so sensitive.
He rubbed his penis up and down her vulva a few times, all the dripping love juices soaking it.
With that lotion applied, he slowly pushed his hips forward.
The head parted her vagina.
Her hole was small and tight, but thanks to all the love juices, it easily accepted his penis.
“Ahhhhhhn!?”
She screamed, but her vagina guided him inside.
The love juices between his cock and her pussy were audibly pushed out along with the air.
(This is the spot.)
Kyle searched through her vagina with his penis and located her g-spot.
Their position was the opposite of before, but it didn’t take him long.
Then he thrusted into her while taking aim at that spot.
“Ahhhh!”
She cried out loud and the base of his penis audibly struck the love juices coating her vulva.
“Kyle! That’s…that’s the spot from before!”
“Yes. It’s your g-spot.”
“I love my jee spot! When you push there, I can barely think! It feels like- ahhh!?”
She tried to say more, but he stimulated her g-spot again and she couldn’t get any more words out.
This stimulation was different from before.
Last time, it had felt like he was pushing at a single point, but now it was a broader feeling, like he was rubbing at a larger surface.
“Hh, Kyle, that’s incredible! Your thick cock is rubbing at my pussy!”
“The previous orgasm must have made it so you can feel the pleasure in the area around the g-spot as well.”
“And this will – ahh – boost my – ahhh – magic!?”
“Yes. This is going well. Your orgasms are linking together nicely.”
“Thank goodness❤”
Emilia went limp, the arms supporting her upper body giving out below her.
Her head fell to the bed, sticking her butt further out toward Kyle.
He angled his penis somewhat downwards to rub at her g-spot as he moved in and out of her vagina.
Her vagina was soaked with love juices and it squeezed his penis tight. He answered that hot squeezing by speeding up his thrusting.
Her love juices made all sorts of sticky sounds.
Every time his hips struck her butt, a cry would leave her lips.
“Ah, ahh, yes, yes! Your cock is rubbing against my jee spot! And the base keeps hitting my pussy’s entrance! It’s so good! I can feel it through my entire body! Ah, ahn! I’m cumming! I’m cumming! I’m having another orgasm❤”
Kyle almost felt like the wild movements of her vaginal walls were coming from his penis.
“This is incredible, princess. Your pussy is trembling.”
“It is? You mean that isn’t your cock? It’s me? It’s my pussy?”
“It is. Your pussy is telling us how much it likes this. That means the g-spot orgasm worked.”
“Good❤ I managed to cum again❤ And with my jee spot this time❤ Ahn❤”
He slowed his hips as he rubbed at her vaginal walls.
It was a gentle motion, like rubbing a sleeping child’s head.
It provided a new stimulation for Emilia immediately after she orgasmed.
“Ah❤ Wow❤ That’s so good❤ I just came…I just orgasmed❤❤ But it already feels good again❤❤❤”
He wasn’t moving anywhere near as much as before, but her g-spot had an intense response.
And the tingling feeling she would normally have felt only in her clit or g-spot had spread to her entire body.
“Ahn!”
He pulled his penis out of her.
That was enough for her body to tremble and for her to collapse onto the bed.
She could tell her love juices were staining the blanket when her crotch touched it, but she didn’t care at the moment.
The simple act of breathing was enough to keep the pleasure going now.
A part of her was trembling deep inside her stomach and that trembling was enough to provide further stimulation. It felt like the process would continue forever, like the waves of the ocean.
But they were not done yet.
“Princess, it is time for the last one – the cervix orgasm.”
“Cervix? Where is that?”
“Excuse me.”
He lifted her up and climbed onto the bed himself.
He sat with his back to the pillow and sat her down in front of him with his arms around her.
It was the same position she had used to hold stuffed animals when she was little.
Then he reached one hand down and rubbed his fingers through her thin blonde pubic hair.
“Your g-spot is this deep in. Your cervix is even further up at the entrance to your womb.”
“Even deeper than my jee spot? Then your fingers won’t reach, will they?”
“No. I’m not even sure my penis will. It didn’t look like I could when doing it from behind just now or when I did on top the other day.”
“Th-then what do we do?”
“You will have to do it yourself.”
He stood up and circled in front of her.
Then he lay on the bed with his legs toward her.
“I want you to get on top of me and put my cock inside you. Then I want you to move it against your cervix.”
“Um, you mean you want me to do the moving?”
“Precisely.”
“…”
Emilia’s mind went blank.
He had always been the one providing her with pleasure when they had sex. She had never even considered actively pursuing that pleasure herself.
But this time she would have to.
She would be moving her hips like he had been earlier and sexually stimulating herself.
“Under…stood.”
She nodded and got up.
She crawled over on top of him.
The tingling pleasure remained in her body and she could feel her own excited anticipation for the even greater pleasure this was sure to provide.
Once she was at his hips, she sat up.
“How about you take off your clothes?”                                                                                                                                          
Kyle reached up toward her dress. He unhooked the back, unbuttoned it, and bared her shoulders.
“U-um, Kyle. I can do the rest.”
She sounded embarrassed as she removed her underclothes and the bra covering her chest.
But stripping with Kyle watching from below was even more embarrassing than she had expected, so she did not bother removing her socks or the dress bunched up around her stomach.
“Is that good enough?”
She lifted up the hem of the dress. This would be enough to keep her clothes from getting dirty.
“Yes, it is,” he kindly confirmed.
In fact, it was more than good enough. The partial state of undress looked even hotter and made his heart pound in his chest, but he left that part unsaid.
The Sex Mark was visible on her lower stomach.
It glowed pink in response to her arousal.
After confirming its presence, Kyle looked up at her large breasts from below.
It was a breathtaking view. The pink tips trembled at the peak of the two perfect hills.
She spoke from past those hills.
“What should I do?”
“First, support my penis with your hand.
“L-like this?”
She awkwardly touched his penis. It trembled at the smooth touch of her hand.
“Yes. Keep it upright like that and then guide it toward your hole. Lift your hips…yes, like that. Good.”
She pressed its head against her vulva. Then she moved her hips around to search out her vagina.
“Oh…there it is. Um, I’m going to put it in.”
“Take it slow.”
“Okay…ah, kyah!?”
She must have let her guard down after finding the hole because she relaxed her legs too much and her hips fell all the way down.
His dick penetrated her all at once with a nice wet sound.
She felt dizzy after the sudden and deep penetration.
Her pubis bumped against his and their pubic hairs tangled together.
“That’s…so good! It’s so…so deep❤ That spot is so sensitive❤ And your cock just hit it❤❤”
“That’s your cervix. I’m impressed you found it so quickly.”
“Really? You mean I’m good at this?”
“Yes. Your body is well on its way to having its magic boosted through the power of orgasms.”
“Yes❤ I did it❤ I’ll cum lots more❤ I’ll have lots more orgasms❤ I’ll boost my magic more and more❤❤”
She started moving her hips around.
She could feel the tip of his penis knocking deep inside her with each move she made. And she felt as much pleasure as the previous clit orgasm each time.
“Ha ha, wow❤ My cervix is incredible❤ It feels like I’m going to cum every time your cock touches it❤”
“Thanks to the orgasms chaining together. Okay, from here on you can move however you like.”
“Ahhn❤ Move on my own?❤ But that’s so indecent❤ And I…I’m a princess❤❤”
“It is not indecent. Man or woman, noble or commoner, everyone loves pleasure.”
He reached out and massaged her breasts.
He squeezed her nipples between his fingers and twisted them as he massaged the rest.
“Kyahhhhh❤ That’s…that’s so good❤ Why? Why am I going to cum just from my boobs?❤ It’s like my entire body is one big clitoris❤”
She writhed as if in fear, but she never did stop moving her hips.
She pulled his penis almost all the way out before dropping her hips back down again. And she repeated the more intense movement.
Each time she dropped her hips down, slamming his cock against her womb, the Sex Mark glowed brighter to show her magic was growing stronger.
Her movements also provided Kyle with great pleasure.
Her vaginal walls squeezed and rubbed at every bit of his penis. And with plenty of speed too.
Her breasts jiggled up and down in time with those movements and her face was entirely melted past them.
She had tears in her blue eyes, saliva dripped from her gaping mouth, and her tongue was visible.
Her blonde hair flew wildly behind her as she indulged in the pleasure.
Seeing her like this naturally aroused Kyle.
“Princess,” he called and embraced her around the shoulders.
She responded by leaning her upper body over to bring her face toward his.
She pressed her lips against his for a kiss.
Their tongues tangled and they swapped saliva.
She could not move her upper body with his arms around her, but she kept just her hips moving just as vigorously.
Skin slapped against skin and sexual juices flew through the air. Lewd sounds filled the room.
“Ah, I-I❤ I can’t think anymore❤ I can’t stop❤ Can’t stop moving my hips❤ Kyle, what am I❤ What am I supposed to do?❤”
“Should I pull out? Your magic has been boosted enough by now.”
“No! Not yet! I want more! I need to cum more!!!!”
Emilia sounded like a begging child.
“Understood, princess.”
He got up without pulling out of her.
And he pushed her onto her back to shift into the missionary position.
￼
“We can finish this with your g-spot. That does seem the best way to bring you to orgasm.”
“Emilia.”
“Eh?”
“Please call me Emilia. And I will call you Kyle.”
“………………………………As you wish, Emilia.”
Her face melted further when he called her name.
“Yay❤ Now thrust deep inside me❤ Make all sorts of dirty sounds inside me❤ Stir me up inside❤ Do it however you want, just do it more❤ More❤”
She placed her right hand behind her right knee and her left hand behind her left knee and lifted her legs.
She pointed her pussy up toward him with his dick still inside it so he could see how much it was twitching.
“I want you to enjoy it too, Kyle❤❤❤”
That pose was just about enough to make him cum.
But he resisted.
“As you wish, Emelia.”
She wanted them to seek pleasure together and achieve climax together.
It was tempting, but he could not agree so readily.
They were not married or even dating.
She was Finegard’s princess and he was a poor noble from the sticks who had been tasked with restoring her magic.
What they were doing here was no more than a way to restore her magic.
He could not cross that line.
But he could not ignore a request from the princess either.
So he chose…
“Please forgive me, Emilia.”
“Eh? Hyah!”
He pulled out of her just before he ejaculated.
Semen erupted from the tip as soon as he did.
It happened too suddenly for Emilia to possibly avoid it.
The released jizz rained down on her.
The semen that fell on her dripped thickly down to pool in the pit of her navel.
The semen that fell on her breasts dripped into the cleavage or toward her armpits with some of it clinging stickily to her nipples and areolae.
The semen also dripped down onto her clothing that looked to be silk and very expensive.
But most of it ended up on her face.
Her shapely eyebrows, her upwards-curling eyelashes, her pointed nose, her pink lips, her milky cheeks, and he silky blonde hair were all covered in the thick smelly white stuff.
“Oh…this is your semen.”
She stared blankly at it for a bit, but she finally raised a hand, scooped some of the cum from her cheek, and carried it to her mouth.
“Wow it’s bitter❤ I don’t think I could normally bear to swallow something like this❤ But knowing it’s yours, I could swallow any amount of it❤ How strange❤”
“You don’t have do that.”
Kyle panicked a little.
He had chosen to cum outside in the hopes that she would still see how much he had enjoyed having sex with her, but he had not expected so much of it to get on her face.
In fact, this was extremely disrespectful. He could hardly complain if he was summarily executed.
But Emilia was not mad and she even happily tasted his semen.
Seeing that gave him an indescribable sense of fulfilment.
“Kyle…did this boost my magic?”
“Yes. Without a hitch.”
His confirmation put a relieved smile on her face.
Then she reached for the semen that had fallen on the rest of her body.
“There’s so much down here too.”
Her eyes stopped on her lower stomach.
The complex emblem there was the Sex Mark.
It faded away as if sinking into her skin.
“Oh, it disappeared again.”
Her disappointed comment was too quiet for Kyle to hear while he hurriedly tried to wipe the cum off of her clothing.
 
The next day, everyone gathered in the castle courtyard.
Emilia stood at the center of a group that included Kyle, Rosetta, Claris, the prime minister, and a few other important people.
 
“Spirits, hear my call. My name is Emilia, the one bound to you by contract.
“Spirits, gather here and grant me your power. My name is Emilia, the one who wishes to seed her lightning power.
“Spirits, Emilia seeks your power, so please grant it!”
 
She recited her incantation and the end of her staff began to glow.
The light made a crackling sound as a cage of lightning formed around her.
“Ohh.”
A stir ran through the gathered people.
Emilia’s magic had been successfully boosted.
Before, she had always used up all of her magic for one powerful lightning attack, but now she could use a small portion of that magic and emit the lightning in any form she liked.
“If you can expand this cage to cover the castle, you can defend against a magical attack by the dark elves,” said Rosetta.
Emilia lowered her staff and the magic vanished.
After a relieved sigh at her success, she looked to Kyle and then Rosetta.
Neither of them noticed the slight reservation in her gaze.
(Why, Kyle?)
Elf Harem Chapter 4: Interrogation – The Dark Elf Likes It in the Ass
“Princess Emilia!”
“I’m fine! I could hold off a blast like that in my sleep!”
Emilia waved her staff and answered Kyle’s call.
She had created a lightning barrier to block the fifth magic attack. A powerful explosion erupted right next to the royal palace.
They were on the palace’s balcony.
Kyle, the maid named Claris, and the prime minister watched as Emilia created a cage of lightning around the entire palace.
Fireballs rained down on the castle town, but she perfectly defended against them all.
The dark elf surprise attack failed to even scratch Finegard’s royal palace.
A day had passed since Kyle boosted her magic.
A guard patrolling the city had captured a suspicious dark elf and interrogation had revealed that attack magic users had already infiltrated the city for a surprise attack.
The elite guards had been sent out immediately for a search and capture operation.
That left the palace less defended, but Emilia used her own magic to make up for it.
Rosetta walked out onto the balcony.
“I have a report. The 10 dark elves we were told of have all been captured.”
“Ohh! Well done!” rejoiced the prime minister.
Emilia’s shoulders lowered in relief and she lowered her staff. The lightning cage around the palace disappeared.
Kyle and Claris breathed sighs of relief.
The threat had passed for the time being.
“Well done, princess.”
Emilia shook her head at the prime minister’s compliment.
“No, this was all thanks to Kyle.”
“This was the result of your training, Princess Emilia,” Kyle replied.
He made sure to use the princess title when others were around. Rosetta and Claris still gave him suspicious looks for using her name at all, but he ignored that.
And Rosetta continued her report.
“Also…we are having trouble with one of the dark elves.”
 
Rosetta brought Emilia, Kyle, and the prime minister to the prison cells. Claris left on the way to return to her maid duties.
The palace’s basement was made into a dark and dank stone dungeon.
“That one.”
Rosetta pointed toward one of the cells.
“Her?”
Emilia gulped and Kyle peered inside the cell.
A female dark elf was held within.
She had the long pointed ears and the body made of both matter and magic in common with the elves, but the deeper-cut facial features and dark skin were different.
The dark elf was handcuffed with the restraints attached to a chain hanging from the ceiling, forcing her upright.
Her feet were still on the floor, but she was stretched to her full height at all times, which could not be comfortable.
She was also blindfolded and gagged with a cloth.
“Did you have to go this far?” Emilia asked Rosetta.
It was true there was no real reason to restrain a prisoner to this extent. And gagging her kept them from interrogating her.
“She attempted to bite her tongue as soon as she was captured,” explained Rosetta. “She appears to have been the other dark elves’ communicator. She used weak wind magic when she attempted to flee.”
Wind magic could be used to send the user’s voice to others over long distances.
And if her magic was so weak, she could not have been one of the ones meant to actually attack the palace.
Thus, she was likely meant to communicate back to the dark elf forces.
“So we might be able to get some useful information out of her,” said Rosetta. “Like the objective behind the recent dark elf attacks. Or…”
“But how can you get her to talk?” asked the prime minister. “If she is willing to bite her tongue and die, I doubt she will be easy to crack.”
“That’s the problem.”
I see, thought Kyle as he viewed the dark elf in the cell.
She was entirely still except for the occasional swaying of her body. She had to be hearing their conversation, but she showed no reaction.
He noticed something when he viewed her magic circuit.
Could it be…?
“Um, would it be all right if I performed her interrogation?”
 
Kyle opened the cell door with the key he had been given and stepped inside. Just to be safe, he locked the door behind him.
Emilia, Rosetta, and the prime minister had gone back upstairs.
Kyle had stopped by his room to collect some things before he returned to the dungeon.
There was a guard at the entrance to the stairs leading down here, but that seemed too far away to hear anything in here.
“Now, then.”
He removed the dark elf’s blindfold.
She had a gag in her mouth, but he could still tell just how breathtakingly beautiful she was.
Her silver hair and gold eyes matched her brown skin perfectly. She had a slender nose and full red lips. Her body had a nice amount of meat on it and she appeared to be a bit older than Kyle himself.
She glared sharply at him the instant the blindfold was removed.
If looks could kill, he would have dropped dead right then and there.
He took a step back so she could get a better look at him while he spoke.
“I am Kyle Vermilion. I will be interrogating you.”
“Hst hhl mhh.”
She tried to say something past her gag.
Probably something like “just kill me”.
He had never expected to actually hear a captured warrior woman say that.
He put on his best evil smile as he continued.
“Oh, don’t worry. I won’t be torturing you or anything as barbaric as that. Then again, this might be even worse than torture.”
He pulled a knife from his bag and sliced off all her clothing.
Once her underwear was gone, all of her dark skin was visible.
With her arms held up by the chain, she couldn’t cover herself with them and simply twisted her body instead.
“Hh hnhr!”
Was that “you monster!”, perhaps?
He shook his head.
“You misunderstand. I am not using this interrogation as an excuse to rape you. I am only interested in interrogating you. This just so happens to be the best way I know of getting you to talk.”
“Heh.”
She scoffed at that idea.
She seemed confident she would never talk.
But Kyle was just as confident she would give in.
“Well, only one way to find out which one of us right.”
With that, he reached a hand toward her body.
He stroked her silver hair, ran his hand from her neck to her chest, felt along her stomach, rubbed her butt, thigh, and calf, and finally reached her foot.
He was inspecting her magic circuit. He discovered that his initial assessment earlier had been accurate.
(This is quite the view.)
He gulped.
He had never seen a dark elf up close before.
Her brown skin was not the same as the dark-skinned humans from the modern world of his past life. It was a strange, shadowy color.
Her body was plump but fit. Her breasts and butt were large, giving her erotic curves that inspired his lust.
Her body had an incredibly sexy intensity to it.
“Hmph.”
When he observed her body so carefully, she gave a mocking snort.
She must have concluded he was precisely the pervert she had initially taken him for.
But he had not been lying to her.
“I want to remove your gag, but you would only bite your tongue if I did, wouldn’t you?”
“Hh hhrse.”
She nodded and said “of course”.
“What if I told you I would kill all of the other captured dark elves if you did that?”
“!”
He did not overlook the waver in her eyes.
She quickly regained control of her expression, but she had failed to hide how much that threat shook her.
“But if you do not kill yourself, they will remain alive and well.”
“Hhh!”
“Now, let’s try this again. You won’t kill yourself if I remove your gag, will you?”
“…”
Her face contorted in frustration, but she ultimately nodded.
Satisfied, Kyle removed the gag.
“Pwah!”
With her first breath, all the accumulated saliva spilled from her mouth. It formed a sagging bridge between her mouth and the gag cloth.
“You…scum!”
“The first thing out of your mouth is an insult, is it?”
He smiled bitterly, but he couldn’t deny it either. That was the role he was playing here.
He was by no means an expert interrogator, but he had experience negotiating with the neighboring nobles to protect his territory. He was confident in his ability to strike deals and persuade.
He kept his guard up as he began the questioning.
“What is your name?”
“Hmph. I have no name for scum like you.”
“Even if that name keeps your comrades alive?”
“…It’s Lielle, you coward!”
The dark elf spat out her name: Lielle.
“Thank you for your cooperation. Now, Lielle, I have a few more questions for you, so I would appreciate it if you answered them.”
“…”
“What is your objective here?”
“…”
“Do you have some sort of commander who ordered this mission?”
“…”
“What other missions did you have planned?”
“…”
She kept her mouth tightly shut for all of the important questions.
“Hm, your cooperation was awfully fleeting. You don’t care about your comrades’ lives?”
“Don’t you mock me. I’ll tell you whatever you want about me, but I can’t tell you anything that would affect the lives of the dark elf people. And I know the others would gladly die to defend that information.”
“I do believe you are mistaken about that.”
At the very least, Lielle had only been captured because another dark elf had given up information on their current mission.
But he feared telling her that would send her into enough despair to kill herself.
“No matter. I have ways to make you talk.”
“I warn you, I won’t crack under torture.”
“I can tell.”
There was a fanatical light glowing deep in her eyes.
That was the light of someone who believed without question that she was doing the right thing.
“And don’t assume you can get me to talk by raping me either.”
For some reason, she looked almost proud of herself.
She may have had a lot of experience with men.
But that didn’t matter to Kyle in the slightest.
“Let’s test that theory, shall we?”
He grabbed her handcuffs and moved her to the center of the cell.
The chain was connected to a pulley on the ceiling which allowed it to be moved freely around.
He had her stand in the center of the floor and attached a restraint around her ankles as well.
That restraint was one of the tools sitting in a corner of the room. It used a metal rod on the front and back to keep her legs spread apart.
The cell had plenty of other tools available for use in interrogation.
But for now, this was all he needed.
“You are good looking, Lielle, I’ll give you that.”
“Tch.”
Her tongue click was more meant to show disgust with Kyle than express embarrassment.
Her restraints forced her arms overhead and forced her hips back behind her.
With her legs also forcibly spread, she was basically displaying her pussy for him.
He stood behind her and viewed the silver bush visible past her large butt. He could also see her pink anus.
(Now this hole, she hasn’t used.)
He judged that from the appearance of her rear hole.
Dark elves viewed sexuality in a similar light to the elves.
He had doubted she would have engaged in anal sex since it wasn’t at all necessary for reproduction, and he had been right.
He pulled two things from the bag he had brought from his room.
The first was a small bottle of lotion like the one he had given to Rosetta to drink.
The second was a sex toy he had made himself.
Five balls were connected together like dumplings on a skewer, but the first ball was the size of a pachinko ball and they gradually grew bigger, with the fifth one the size of a ping pong ball.
He held the toy in front of her face so she could see it.
“Hmph. So what, you’re going to rape me with that silly little toy? Fine, but I take much bigger things in there all the time.”
“Oh, I’m sure you do. But what about up your ass?”
“…………Huh?”
She did not seem to understand what he meant at first.
In lieu of answering, he opened the bottle of lotion and poured it onto her ass.
“Hyah!”
She wiggled her hips from the chilly sensation.
He rubbed the sticky lotion in with his hands.
This one was a more viscous variety than what he had Rosetta drink. Once he was done, Lielle’s butt glistened in the cell’s light.
After adding some more lotion and placed a hand on one cheek, he slid his fingers in between them.
With a sticky sound, his middle finger touched her anus.
“Hyah!? What do you think you’re doing!? Why would you touch me there!?”
“Because I need to get everything all lubed up to avoid hurting you.”
He repeatedly moved his finger to and from the hole, the lotion making sticky sounds and bubbling up at her anal entrance.
“Ah, why…with your finger like that!?”
She struggled, but she was chained up and could not escape. She only succeeded in rattling the chain overhead.
He ran his finger in circles around her anus.
The hole trembled as if in fear.
He gradually pushed down with more force.
With every light push, her anus would twitch and push back.
“Hm, you have a very hungry ass.”
“Hungry? Have you gone completely insane?”
“Maybe I have.”
He pushed his finger inside her anus.
“Kyahh!?”
She let out an awfully cute shriek.
Her hole reacted to her very first anal violation by squeezing and trying to push out the intruder.
He gently moved his finger, using the lotion to gradually push further in. Once his finger was in up to the second joint, he stopped.
“How does it feel, Lielle?”
“Wh-what…in the world? It’s just a finger…in my ass. But it feels so weird…like I can’t breathe. It’s disgusting.”
She let out an agonized breath and explained her thoughts.
He pushed his finger further inside.
“Ah, no, no! Stop, wait, what is this? No, no, noooo!”
He ignored her screams, pushing his middle finger all the way inside.
He felt her squeezing so tight he thought she would crush his finger.
This force was trying to expel his finger, so it was very unlike the squeezing of a vagina.
But he fought back, moving his finger around inside her.
He loosened up the dark elf’s ass.
“Stop! Messing with that hole…won’t accomplish anything!”
“Won’t it, though? I mean, I’m already hearing some sticky noises while I finger your ass.”
“No…that can’t be true!”
That was of course only the lotion.
The intestinal juices secreted by the small intestine were only meant to prevent injury to the anus and rectum, so they had nothing to do with sexual pleasure.
But Lielle was not aware of that.
“Lielle, you’re experiencing pleasure from a finger inside your anus. If there’s something wrong with anyone here, I think it’s you.”
She easily fell for his lies.
“N-no! I’m normal! I’m normalllll!”
When he pressed the finger on the vaginal side wall, her entire body writhed.
The movement caused her brown tits to jiggle. The bright pink tips were already erect.
He pulled his finger out.
A string of lotion came with his finger as it was expelled from her anus. The hole opened and closed a few times like it was breathing.
“Look how badly it wants my finger back. Your ass loves having things inside it, doesn’t it?”
“No. That’s not true!”
She struggled in her restraints, but she could not confidently deny his claim even to herself.
She could feel the muscles down there tensing against her will.
She could not confidently state that the throbbing she felt inside that hole was not pleasure.
(This is going to be even easier than I thought.)
He reached that conclusion while watching her writhing in response to his words.
His previous investigation had confirmed that the focal point of her magic circuit – and thus the point he needed to stimulate – was her anus.
Pleasuring her through anal stimulation would recover her magic.
But recovery was not his goal here.
Magic tended to gather in a magic circuit’s focal point.
That allowed him to inject a lot of magic there, but it also allowed him to take a lot of magic from there.
He showed her the same sex toy as before.
“You’ve loosened up a lot back here, so I think it’s time to try putting this in there.”
“Wh-what is that?”
“A sex toy used for masturbation. But this one’s special. I had it made from draingrass root.”
“Wha-!?”
A short shriek escaped from deep in her throat.
Draingrass was a type of plant that stole magic from the living things it caught in its trap. Elves were half made of magic, so it might as well have been a carnivorous plant for them.
This sex toy was made by surrounding the plant’s roots with wood to weaken the draining effect. And while he said he “had it made”, he had actually made it himself.
“Wh-what are you going to do with that?”
“I thought I already explained that: put it in your ass.”
“But why would you- ahhh!”
He pressed the tip of the anal beads against her labia, which were plenty wet with the lotion that had dripped down from her ass.
“But first you can learn its shape in your pussy. Can you feel the five different sizes of ball rubbing against your clit one after another?”
With a sticky sound, he parted her pussy lips with the five balls and rubbed them back and forth.
Each time one touched her clitoris, her ass hopped up.
Finally, a sticky fluid other than the lotion seeped out onto the sex toy.
“Looks like this hole is ready to go too. Were you hoping I would put it inside?”
She leaped at the possibility he presented there.
“Y-yes! Do that! It’s better than the alternative!”
“Be more specific about what you want and I might just consider it.”
“…”
She trembled in humiliation.
But she decided this was better than having that thing pushed up her ass.
“Please! Shove that…toy in my pussy!”
“Very well done.”
“Then…!”
“I considered it, but…no, it’s going in your ass.”
“How dare you- eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!?”
The first and smallest bead entered her ass.
It went in smoothly after he loosened her up with his finger.
“Hh, hh, hh, you’re absolute scum!”
She glared tearfully back at him and he grinned.
Even he could tell it was a much more sadistic smile than he usually used.
He had never tried this before since it would actively hinder the magical recovery.
But this time, he was trying to get her to talk by taking away her magic, so he played the role of the ruthless interrogator.
“Please. I personally think I’m being charitably kind since you’re one of the criminals who attacked our city.”
“This is not- ghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”
He pushed the second and third beads in at the same time.
“How does that feel? It’s in there deeper than my finger was now. Feels good, doesn’t it?”
“N-no, I don’t like it at all!”
“Oh, you’ll get used to it.”
He pushed the fourth bead in.
The fourth one was already thicker than his finger, so he worked it in there gradually, never forcing it.
“No, that’s…wait, I can feel the tip poking at my belly. Ahh, and the hole is spreading so wide. No, noooooo!”
Her asshole swallowed the fourth bead like it was a favorite treat.
The hole trembled like it was asking for the final bead.
“You’re doing quite well. I bet you can take the final bead too.”
“N-no, don’t. It’s too big! It won’t fit! It won’t!”
Lielle twisted her body around in a desperate attempt to resist.
But the more she moved, the more the anal beads worked at her ass, spreading it wider.
He added some more lotion and then grabbed the sex toy again.
He moved it in a circular motion while pushing to slowly work the final bead inside her.
“Nooo! Ah, ghh! Ah, ahh! Ohhhhh!”
She started groaning like an animal while her hips shook.
The final bead finally vanished inside her ass.
The skin around her anus was pushed out before returning to normal.
But the hole itself was still sitting open just a bit.
He moved the anal beads around inside her using the grip that was sticking out.
“That’s all of them inside you.”
“Ugh…what is this? My stomach feels so heavy…and like there’s something squirming around inside me.”
She wrinkled her brow at the sensation, but he was only getting started.
Little by little, he moved them around inside her more and more.
For her, it was a very strange feeling like something was pushing at her stomach from within.
And…
“Huh? Wh-what? My body…”
Her strength gave out and her knees buckled.
But with her handcuffed arms still held up by the chain, she could not even sit down.
“Remember what I said? These anal beads are made from draingrass root.”
Her recovery point was her anus, so the draingrass toy was absorbing her magic from there.
For an elf, having your magic taken was like having your lifeforce taken. He had of course made sure this draingrass could not actually kill her, but the feeling of absorption still provided a similar fear.
“N-no, wait, no. What? My strength is being drained…drained from my ass!?”
Lielle shook her body side to side.
She was probably trying to force the anal beads out with centrifugal force, but that wasn’t actually possible. Instead, it looked more like she was shaking her tits and ass to seduce him.
“No, take it out! Please take it out!” she screamed.
“If you want it out, remove it yourself.”
“Eh?”
“It’s in your ass, remember? I would understand if it was in your pussy, but that hole has muscles specifically designed to push things out of it.”
“You can’t mean it…” she said with despair in her voice.
She had to push those five beads out of her ass while some pervert elf was watching?
“C’mon, you’d better hurry if you don’t want all your magic drained away.”
“Kh!”
For an elf, feeling your magic draining away was a different sort of fear from that of dying.
Lielle had been prepared to kill herself, but this fear she could not fight.
She gathered strength in her ass.
Her large and shapely butt changed shape somewhat as the skin around the anus spread out.
The hole opened and then closed a few times as she hesitated, but eventually the largest of the beads started to push out.
“Oh, now you’ve got it. It’s starting to come out, so keep at it.”
“Ghhhh.”
This would have been embarrassing enough without Kyle standing behind her, carefully observing her anus.
But she still worked at it, pushing the bead.
Finally, just as it looked like her anus had spread too wide and was going to push itself inside out, the largest bead popped on out.
The rest happened all at once, the consecutively smaller beads popping out one after another.
Lielle breathed a sigh of relief.
But…
“Well done!”
“Ahhhhhhhhhn!?”
He pushed the anal beads all the way back in.
This time, he shoved all five beads in without stopping.
“What is wrong with you!? I just worked so hard to get that out of there!”
“Yeah, but it took you so long. I thought maybe you could set a new personal best now that you’ve got the hang of it.”
“I can’t believe you!”
She gnashed her teeth and glared back at him.
She wanted to beat the shit out of him, but that wasn’t an option with her arms and legs bound.
And if she didn’t do something about the anal beads in her ass, her magic would be drained away, so she focused her mind on her anal muscles again.
She expelled the beads from her body.
She felt an indescribable feeling of relief as each bead left her anus.
And yet…
“Well done!”
“Ghhhhhhhhhh!?”
Just before the final bead was out, Kyle shoved them all back inside her again.
“Wh-why!? What do you hope to accomplish with this!?”
“Do I really have to explain that? Or did you forget that I’m interrogating you?”
“…”
She gasped.
She had forgotten. She was being interrogated by her captors and that was a magic tool that drained her magic from her ass. Kyle’s actions were (extremely perverted but) logical.
She had been so focused on her anus she had forgotten that.
(B-but not because I like this!)
She quickly added that clarification.
Anyone would end up focusing on their anus if someone was doing all this weird stuff to it.
“Hey, what’re you sitting around for? Take too long and you won’t have any magic left.”
“!”
After his reminder, she got to work expelling the anal beads again.
But the result was the same. Just as the last one was coming out, he pushed all five back inside her.
She repeated the process over and over, sinking further into despair each time.
She would push and the beads would pop out, but then Kyle would push back and they would pop back in.
Each time, her anus would open and close like it was breathing and her innards would squirm.
She was experiencing the same refreshing feeling briefly felt on the toilet, but this was over and over again.
“Stop!’ she shouted. “Now you’re just moving it on your own!”
Kyle was indeed pulling the anal beads out and pushing them back in all on his own.
Thanks to all the lotion, they made sticky sounds on the way in and out.
“If you do that, you’ll break my anus! It will never be the same again!”
“You say that, but what’s with the occasional moans of pleasure I’m hearing?”
“You’re…ahn♥…imagining things!”
The pleasure was due to the beads occasionally rubbing toward the front of her body and stimulating her vagina.
There was a barrier of flesh in the way, but it was still enough to fill her with pleasure.
“You have a magic-draining device shoved up your ass, but all you can do is moan in pleasure? You’re as perverted as they come.”
“Again, you’re imagining things! I am not feeling any pleasure at- ohhhh!?”                                                                                                                                          
He pushed it inside her extra hard and then pulled it all the way out.
She felt like her body was being turned inside out.
A tremor ran from her butt to her spine and she arched her back.
“Hh…ahh…”
She no longer had anything in her ass, but her anus continued to squirm.
The feeling of the five beads moving in and out would not leave her.
It was similar to the throbbing sense of accomplishment she felt on the toilet.
Kyle removed her handcuffs and she collapsed face down on the stone floor.
“Too weak to stand, aren’t you?”
“Ugh…”
She was.
She tried to lift her newly-freed upper body, but it wouldn’t budge. It felt just like when she had used too much magic.
“Your magic is running out. The amount you need to sustain your body is greater than the amount you can recover in this state, so you will eventually run out and die.”
“Kh…”
Lielle trembled in fear.
But the fear of having to feel that sense of draining magic again was greater than the fear of death.
“You have two options here,” said Kyle. “You can lie here and feel your magic gradually slipping away, or you can answer my questions and receive my recovery magic.”
“Recovery…magic?”
“Correct.”
“Nhh!?”
She felt something hot and hard pressed between her ass cheeks. The twitching object was clearly not a dildo. This was a real live body part.
“My recovery magic supplies magic to the focal point of your magic circuit, drastically increasing your magic recovery rate. Your focal point – and thus recovery point – is your anus, so I will fill that with semen that is packed full of my magic.”
“You mean…you’ll be putting that thing in my butt?”
“Yes, I will have to put my cock in there. Just like I did with the beads.”
“You must be joking! That doesn’t even make sense!!”
Lielle shouted in confusion.
Just like most elves, she saw the anus as an exit for waste and the penis as something that went inside the vagina, so he almost sounded like he was speaking some foreign language to her.
But after her experience with the anal beads, she could easily imagine what it would be like.
His penis would push into her ass like it was her pussy.
Then he would thrust in and out of that hole.
And finally his hot cum would explode from the tip.
(Wh-what? Why?)
She was surprised to find herself trembling in anticipation.
No, she told herself she was trembling in fear. Or maybe the idea was so disgusting that her mind rejected it outright and her body had gotten confused.
“So what will it be?”
Kyle pressed her for an answer and she knew exactly what her answer was.
“Wh-why even bother asking? I swear on my life and the life of my fellow dark elves that I have no answers to give scum like you.”
“I see. That’s disappointing.”
He removed the restraint from her legs as well. She was now entirely naked and lying face down on cell floor.
“Then I doubt we will ever meet again. I am curious to see what an elf looks like after losing all her magic and drying up, though.”
“Ah…”
She heard his receding footsteps.
She was too weak to even look in that direction.
Once he left, her death was assured.
And she would continue to lose magic through the moment she lost consciousness for the last time. She would suffer from this horrific sensation the entire time.
She felt despair, fear, anxiety, and an indescribable loneliness.
A vague, nightmarish feeling spread through her chest.
She hated it.
Would this go away if she only had some magic?
Magic…
“…Wait.”
“Yes?”
His footsteps stopped.
She bit her lip.
She bit it hard enough to draw blood before the words spilled out of her.
“I’ll talk…I’ll tell you everything! So give me magic! Pump me full of your magic!”
It was only a moment, but it had felt like an eternity to Lielle.
But when she heard Kyle’s footsteps again, they were gradually approaching and she finally heard his whispered voice tickling her ear.
“That’s what I wanted to hear.”
 
The information they could get from Lielle was crucial, but Kyle figured it wasn’t needed immediately and he prioritized providing her with some magic.
He had of course made sure the draingrass anal beads could not remove a deadly amount of magic, but Lielle had to be terrified since she didn’t know that.
His goal here was her information, not to torment her.
“Then point your butt this way.”
“Uh, kh…I can’t. I’m too weak.”
She managed to wiggle her butt a little, but she could not lift it from the floor.
“Fine. I’ll help you out.”
He grabbed her hips and lifted them.
That put her in a provocative pose with just her hips sticking up from the floor.
With her anus opening and closing in that pose, the lotion remaining inside her spilled out and dripped down to her labia.
“Ugh…why does this have to happen to me?”
“Because you asked me to do it.”
“Only because you stole all of my mag- ahhh!”
He ran his finger along her vulva, eliciting a pathetic cry from her.
“You have an awful lot of energy for someone without any magic. I think this is even more love juices than before.”
“What? That can’t be true…”
He stirred up her pussy, making lots of sticky noises for her to hear. When he occasionally stimulated her clitoris, her body would tremble against her will.
The sexual pleasure she felt was steadily growing. That meant she would be able to recover plenty of magic even though this was her first time having anal sex.
He stripped off his slacks and underwear, pulling out his erect penis.
He let his own saliva drip down and rubbed it on with his hand before pressing the tip against Lielle’s anus.
“Can you feel this? It’s my cock. I am about to push it inside your anus.”
“Wait! On second thought…”
“Too late. You already sold out your entire dark elf operation for this cock.”
“Ghhhhhhhh!!”
He pushed his penis all the way inside her ass.
She had already been loosened up by the anal beads, so her ass easily accepted his erection.
“Oh…wow.”
This felt entirely different from a vagina. The pressure felt like it was going to crush his dick.
But not in an unpleasant way. It provided a different sort of pleasure from being inside a vagina.
“No, noooo! This is…this is completely different from before!”
Lielle, on the other hand, screamed.
His cock applied much more pressure to her stomach than the beads had.
The thick meat stick filled up her ass and pushed deep inside, reshaping her insides to match its form.
The tip also pushed at the inner wall to stimulate her vagina on the other side. Her own flesh pushed on her g-spot, hitting her with a form of pleasure she had never felt before.
“Okay, I’m going to move now.”
“Wait! Hold on! Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhhh!”
The previous lotion made sticky noises as his cock moved in and out of her ass.
Unlike with the beads, her anus never had a chance to squeeze back together. The skin around the hole and the muscles were spread wide while it pushed in and out of her, so the powerful sensation spread through her entire lower body.
The tip continued to stimulate her vagina’s g-spot through the inner wall.
More and more, she found she couldn’t tell if the pleasures she was feeling came from the attack on a pleasure spot she was familiar with or from the fat cock moving in and out of her asshole.
“No, ah, no! That thick thing is stirring up my insides!”
“Kh, you’re squeezing so damn tight.”
He continued thrusting in and out so her anus would get to know what a penis felt like.
The pressure gradually lessened, making it easier to move, but enough pressure remained to be pleasant.
At the same time, he gradually increased the speed of his thrusting.
Before long, his hips were slapping against her large brown ass, making it jiggle.
“Damn, that’s hot. Your round ass is shaking like a dog wagging its tail. You really like taking it up the ass, don’t you?”
“No, that can’t possibly be truuuue!?”
“But your pussy has been dripping with love juices ever since I put it in here?”
“That’s not- ahhhhhhhh!!”
She screamed after an especially powerful thrust.
When his hips slapped against her ass, her lower body shook and that shaking sent a throbbing through her clit. She was being attacked on the inside and outside.
“See, your ass just squeezed even tighter. Like it doesn’t want to let my cock go. That hole is saying it’s made for cock. It might as well be another pussy.”
“No! That is not what it’s for! It is not a pussy! Ahhh!?”
Her denial was followed by a cry of pleasure from another thrust.
Now that he had pointed it out, she could tell her anus was squeezing in response to the stimulation.
Her insides seemed to squeeze at his penis and take its shape.
“Gh, ah, ah, no. This isn’t right. There’s something wrong with me!”
“Don’t fight it. Can’t you feel your magic recovering already?”
“…It’s true.”
She only noticed it then.
That was thanks to the saliva he had covered his penis with ahead of time. It contained his magic, so her magic circuit had reacted and her magic had recovered.
“So if I keep doing you in the ass, your magic will return to normal.”
“Ah…thank goodness.”
Lielle felt the tension leaving her body.
Only then did she realize how tense she had been.
She was finally released from the fear of having her magic drained away.
But then Kyle pulled his penis out of her ass.
“Hweh? Why? Why did you pull it out!?”
“Change your position please. It would wear us both out to use the same position the entire time, right? So lie on your back this time.”
“Ugh…okay.”
She pulled her butt in and slowly rolled onto her side. She had recovered a little, but she still didn’t have much magic. Her body was sluggish.
But she still managed to get on her back. She lifted her legs and wiggled her hips in a pose that gave him a view of her vagina and anus.
“Doing you like this would be difficult. You’ll need to lift her legs and butt even more.”
“Ghhhhh!”
Lielle worked desperately to do as he asked. She lifted her hips high enough to give him a great view of her ass. The air contacted her anus, filling her with a strangely refreshing feeling.
“I-is that better?”
“Yes, perfect. Now, let’s continue.”
“Khhh!”
He pushed his penis inside her ass again.
Her thoroughly loosened hole obediently accepted the head. The lotion made sticky sounds as he pushed his way from her anal canal to her lower rectum, upper rectum, and finally to the sigmoid colon, the curving connection between the rectum and the colon.
“Ghhhhhhhhhhhhh!? What is that!? It’s incredible! It’s all tingly! It’s like there’s electricity running through my ass!”
Lielle cried out with her voice melting.
Those inner walls had no pain or touch receptors.
But there were sensory nerves concentrated around the sigmoid colon, so pushing on the colon there would stimulate those surrounding nerves and bring pleasure.
The change of position had allowed his penis to reach this deep.
“Agh, what? If you keep hitting me there, you’ll destroy my ass!”
He got gravity’s help to drop his hips down toward her ass, sending an impact through her entire body.
“Just lift her ass like I told you to. Otherwise I won’t give you my cum.”
“No! I need your cum! I need magic! So give me your cum! I’ll point my asshole up for you!”
She placed her hand around her legs and folded her body, placing her knees next to her face.
“Yes, that should work.”
He lightened up on the thrusting after she changed position. He lifted his body so he could see her entire body.
“Here, have a reward.”
“Nhhhhh!?”
And he teased her clit with his thumb.
“Wait! Don’t do that! Nhhh!”
“Then how about this?”
He stuck his index and middle finger in her vagina.
He could feel his penis moving in and out of her ass on the other side of the flesh barrier.
“Ghhhhhhh! That’s so good! You’re stirring up both holes! I can’t even thiiiiiiiiiiink! It’s good! So good! Too good!”
“You’re squeezing even tighter now. Kh, I’m about to cum.”
“Yay! Cum! In my ass! Fill my ass with your sperm!”
Directly above her anus and near her tailbone, a complex pattern appeared on her skin.
That was the Sex Mark. It proved Lielle and Kyle’s magic circuits had been linked.
The dark elf prisoner was now truly feeling pleasure from anal sex.
Her ass squeezed tight, letting her feel the shape of the penis fucking her.
￼
The thick shaft spread the skin around the entrance. The head rubbed all over the inner walls. The tip thrusted deep, deep inside her.
Every time it went inside her, she felt like her entire body was being sucked into her ass. Every time it left her, she felt like her entire body was being turned inside out from that point.
And now that all provided her with tingling pleasure.
“Agh! Wow❤ Yes❤ It’s so good❤ Your cock is filling my ass❤ It’s never closing back up again❤ Ah, ah, your cock is throbbing now. Are you going to cum? Are you going to fill me with your cum?❤❤❤”
“I am! I’m going to pump your ass pussy full of semen.”
“Give it to my ass!❤ Fill my ass pussy with cum❤ Fill it with so much it fills up my stomach too❤❤❤”
“Hh, kh!”
His semen erupted out.
It flowed the wrong way, moving from her sigmoid colon to the colon itself.
“Ahhhhh❤ Yes❤ So much cum inside me❤ It just keeps coming❤ I love it, I love it so muuuuuuuch❤❤❤”
She felt the ejaculation hitting her inside and her empty vagina throbbed all on its own.
That throbbing spread to her ass as well.
“Ugh, your ass pussy is amazing. I swear it’s trying to milk me of every last drop.”
“Ahh, give it to me❤ Give it all to me❤ I need all that magic or I’ll die❤ So I want all the cum you’ll give me❤❤❤❤❤”
She locked her raised legs around his back to make sure he couldn’t pull out until he had released all of his semen inside her.
She also moved her hips and tightened her anus to squeeze his penis. That applied pressure to the base while all the semen remaining in the shaft was sucked out by her insides.
“Ahhh, gh.”
Finally, he managed to pull his penis out.
Her anus sat open even after the thick cock had left it. It opened and closed like it was breathing, with some milkiness spilling out from time to time.
“Ahhh, what a waste❤ So much cum is leaking out❤❤”
She lifted her own legs and hips again and used her finger to scoop up the escaping semen and pushed it back into her ass.
“Ah, ahh❤ Cum❤ So much cum❤ This will give me my magic back❤❤”
“Yes, your magic is already back to normal. Congratulations.”
“Yay. Thank you, Kyle❤❤❤”
The dark elf woman answered him with a melted face that made her look like a completely different person than the one who had been chained up in here earlier.
 
After cleaning up the semen from Lielle’s body and the floor, Kyle chained her up again and left the cell.
He also put the gag back in just to be safe, but he doubted she would try to kill herself again now.
The fanatical light he had seen in her eyes before was gone.
Enough sexual pleasure to make her lose her senses had in fact brought her back to her senses.
“Before long, I will request that you and the other dark elves are released,” he told her while locking the cell door.
She nodded.
But Kyle failed to notice the person who rushed back up the stairs from the dungeon as he left the cell.
That person had been watching his interrogation of the dark elf after descending into the dungeon midway through.
She hid behind a corner of the hallway and watched Kyle leave while awkwardly rubbing her legs together within her skirt.
Her pussy was soaked inside her panties.
She needed to hurry back to her room and change.
With that plan in mind, she – Emilia – spoke under her breath.
“Why won’t you ejaculate inside me like that, Kyle?”
Elf Harem Chapter 5: Unleashed Sexuality – Threesome with the Sharp-Tongued Maid and the Princess
The nobles had gathered in a hall of Finegard’s royal palace.
This was not where the party had been held the other day. It was smaller and with a plainer interior. Long ago, before this had become the capital, the room had been used as a wartime strategy room.
The many nobles were seated around a long table.
A map with the capital in the center was laid out on the table.
Princess Emilia, Royal Knight Rosetta, and Kyle sat at the head of the table.
Kyle was here to relay the information he had received from the dark elf prisoner named Lielle
The other nobles made no attempt to hide the suspicion and envy in their gazes.
Kyle himself knew a lower noble like him had no business being here.
But the princess herself had requested his presence and the others had no room to complain when they had fled for their lives during the dark elf attack the other day.
(This has turned into a big deal.)
Kyle had never imagined anything like this when he left his rural mansion, but he dutifully explained what the dark elves were up to.
“The dark elves have attacked three times now. They deployed troops to the eastern plains, they attacked a fortress’s supplies, and they infiltrated the capital. But it turns out these were all only meant to distract us.”
A stir ran through the nobles.
“Their sporadic attacks have forced us onto the defensive while they deploy a much larger force to take the capital once and for all. And that force is gathering here.”
Kyle indicated a point on the map.
The capital was surrounded by mountains in every direction but east. There was a clearing in the forest in that direction and the dark elf forces were supposedly gathering there.
“Then what are we doing here when we could be attacking them!?” protested one of the nobles. “The dark elves are mere nomads. Attack them and they will flee.”
Kyle wanted to snap back that the man had been quick to flee himself, but Emilia let it slide and answered his question.
“That would only mean a repeat of this cycle. It would be better to let them gather their forces for a while and then deliver a devastating blow that leaves them unable to regroup for a very long time to come.” Emilia looked to all the nobles in turn. “Or so my father, the king, says.”
She used that last statement to cut off any further complaints.
 
After deciding to attack the dark elves in five days’ time and planning out what preparations everyone was to make, the meeting came to an end.
“Do you think they’ve realized about my father?” nervously asked Emilia on the way back to her room.
“Good question,” said Kyle, the only person walking with her.
The prime minister had gone to his office to write up the summons letters for the nobles who had not been here for the meeting and Rosetta had gone with the other royal knights to train.
“I imagine a lot of them found it odd that the king was not present at the meeting. Some may have even guessed the reason why.”
The king, Emilia’s father, had already passed away and his body was being stored in the castle basement.
Since elf bodies were half made of magic, the decomposing could be greatly slowed with magic tools, but they could not put off the funeral forever. This was not something they could hide indefinitely.
“I want to end this conflict with the dark elves as soon as possible,” said Kyle.
“So…do I,” replied Emilia, sounding somehow hesitant.
A strange feeling was roiling inside her.
She did want to end this conflict and she did want to let her father rest in peace, but another part of her hoped this situation would last forever.
(Then Kyle will have to continue restoring my magic.)
Last night, he had stimulated her g-spot with his penis to restore her magic again.
But he still did not ejaculate inside her.
She knew a man’s greatest pleasure came from ejaculation, so this meant he was not truly enjoying his time with her.
Did that mean he felt no pleasure when doing it with her?
He did ejaculate with Rosetta and Lielle.
So once the dark elf conflict was over and he no longer had to restore her magic, he might no longer stimulate her g-spot the way she liked.
She hated that thought.
(Oh, I’m so indecent!)
She quickly put a stop to that line of thinking.
“Is something wrong, Emilia?”
“N-no.”
She rapidly shook her head at his question.
 
“Welcome back, Princess Emilia.”
Emilia returned to her room to find Claris there. She must have been cleaning.
“Perfect timing, Claris. I wanted to speak with you.”
“Oh. Were you here too, Baron Vermilion?”
The maid acted like she had failed to notice Kyle’s presence.
He smiled bitterly.
“Why are you always so cold with me?”
“Am I? That has not been my intent, but I apologize if I have offended you in any way.”
She bowed and rattled that off so fast it did not sound remotely genuine. Somehow, even the bow felt like her heart wasn’t in it.
He had spoken with this green-haired maid a few times since he started living in the palace, but he still couldn’t figure out what went on in her head.
She always twisted her politeness into an insult when it came to him and he could tell she disliked him, but he did not know why.
(Well, I can make a pretty good guess.)
But there was no point in pursuing that right now.
“Claris,” he said to the maid. “Could I develop your magic circuit?”
“Huh?”
Claris was taken aback, but she did not let it show on her face. She observed Kyle with no change of expression.
Emilia, on the other hand, freaked out.
She moved between Kyle and Claris and practically grabbed at Kyle as she questioned him.
“K-K-K-Kyle!? Wait just a second. Y-you mean you’re going to use your recovery magic on her?”
“Yes,” he confirmed before turning to Claris. “You use recovery magic as well, don’t you?”
“I do, although I cannot imagine how you discovered this. However…”
“I can tell just by looking at you. And you mistakenly believe your magic is extremely weak.”
“……………What is that supposed to mean?”
Claris’s eyebrows twitched at the part he emphasized.
Kyle smiled at finally getting a reaction out of the maid.
But he opted not to directly answer her question.
“Why don’t you test it out and see if it really is that weak?”
“…”
Claris remained silent for a while, but she finally gave a curt response.
“No, thank you.”
“Oh, and why is that?”
“Well…”
She trailed off and glanced over at Emilia, but then she started to leave without a word more.
“Wait,” he called out. “You can’t just leave without giving me an answer. Or is there some reason you don’t want to answer?”
“Not really…”
“Claris, developing your magic circuit and boosting your recovery magic is crucial for the attack on the dark elves five days from now. And to ensure we lose as few people as possible on our side. Isn’t that right, Princess Emilia?”
“Eh? Oh, yes. Of course.”
Caught off guard, Emilia quickly agreed with him.
He had never said anything to her about Claris’s magic circuit, but she figured he would know best. And they had mentioned in the meeting that the limited number of recovery magic users was a concern.
Kyle gave a solemn nod and continued.
“Can you say no to Princess Emilia, Claris?”
“…”d
“Please tell us why you refuse to develop your magic circuit. Why would you refuse something that would help your princess and your kingdom?”
“Because…”
“Because?”
“Because there…”
“There?”
“There is no way I could do that!”
She spun around to face Kyle so fast her maid uniform’s skirt fluttered up and she raised her voice.
Emilia’s eyes widened.
She had never heard her maid yell before.
Claris glared at Kyle with more emotion than she had ever let show and she pointed at Emilia’s bed.
“Who do you think makes that bed every day!? I do! Did you really think I wouldn’t notice what you were doing to her and what your recovery magic entails!? I decided to feign ignorance as long as you didn’t say anything, but I never imagined you would try to ensnare me as well!”
“Claris…oh, god. You know everything?”
Emilia was badly shaken, but Kyle was not surprised.
He had expected Claris to have noticed what he and Emilia were doing.
How she felt about it had been a major unknown, however.
Based on this reaction, she didn’t like it one bit.
(But I get the feeling it’s more than that.)
And he could not just give up now.
They badly needed a dedicated healer for the upcoming battle against the dark elves.
But there was no time to search out someone new and he could not boost the magic circuit of someone he barely knew. Claris was the perfect candidate given the circumstances.
He needed her agreement no matter what, so he made some guesses about what was going on inside her and continued speaking.
“I see. So you’re saying you know what my recovery magic requires and you don’t want to do those things?”
“E-exactly.”
“But is your problem with me doing those things to you? Or is it with the acts themselves?”
“I don’t understand. Aren’t those the same thing?”
“No.” Kyle shook his head and gestured toward Emilia fidgeting restlessly next to him. “For example, what if it were Princess Emilia doing those things to you?”
“!”
Kyle noticed a clear reaction in Claris’s body when he said that.
Her shoulders and pointy ears jumped up and her green eyes briefly flitted over to Emilia before returning to him.
“That…is an absurd suggestion. Besides, the recovery magic is performed by you, so it is a meaningless hypothetical.”
“What if it was possible?”
“Please stop presenting me with meaningless hypotheticals.”
“Interesting. Maybe it is only a hypothetical, but I notice you can’t bring yourself to say you would still be opposed to it. Does that mean you are open to doing that kind of thing with Princess Emilia?”
“Uhh!?”
He pushed in with his absurd logic and she took a few steps back. Emilia gave the maid a curious look.
“Claris?”
She did not seem to fully understand what those two were talking about. The concept of lesbian sex may have been foreign to her.
Kyle spoke up before those two could speak.
“How about we try it out?”


“Hey, let go of me!”
The maid was lying on the bed.
Kyle held her arms down over her head and Emilia was down at her feet, still looking confused.
“Um, Kyle? Should we really be doing this? Claris is protesting.”
“You protested at first too, remember?”
“O-only because you kissed me without warning.”
“Kissed!?” shouted Claris.                                                                                                                                          
“That’s right.” Kyle grinned. “Just like this.”
“Ah…”
He called Emilia over and she ran to him like a pet dog. And she went after his lips greedily when he offered them to her.
“Nh, ah…Kyle, nh, kh…”
He sent saliva from his mouth to hers and she started to swallow it like she usually did.
“Wait a second, Princess Emilia. Keep it in your mouth.”
“Hweh?”
He suddenly removed his lips from hers and made that demand, so she froze in an awkward pose.
“Now give it to Claris.”
She tried to respond, but her voice was badly distorted by the saliva filling her mouth.
Embarrassed by that, she looked away from him and found Claris’s eyes watching her from below with a look of confusion.
She then gave Kyle a look that said “really?”
“Yes. I doubt Claris will ever except my recovery magic otherwise, so please.”
She felt she had no choice when he asked her like that.
With “for Finegard” in her mind, Emilia lowered her face toward Claris’s.
“Princess Emilia…”
That maid had been with her since she was little.                                            
Her face should have been so familiar, but it looked almost like a stranger’s right now.
Was that due to the unusual circumstances, or was it the combination of embarrassment and fear on the maid’s usually expressionless face?
“Nh.”
Their lips touched.
The soft sensation was subtly different from Kyle’s. She stuck her tongue inside, rubbing them across Claris’s front teeth, which opened with surprisingly little resistance.
Emilia tilted her head to the side as if trying to match the shapes of their lips.
She felt Claris’s breath on her cheek and she could guess her own breath was reaching Claris’s cheek.
(Oh, right. I have to give her Kyle’s saliva.)
That frothy mass was gathered on the back of her tongue, so she let it roll along the top of her tongue.
“Nh, mhh, nhhhh.”
Claris had to know what it was and she showed some resistance, but Emilia pushed it from her lips and into the other girl’s mouth.
Then she slowly pulled her lips away.
The clear, sticky fluid formed a string between them until gravity pulled it down toward Claris.
“…”
The maid frowned like she had just been given a poison and she had not swallowed any of the saliva in her mouth.
Emilia leaned down and whispered in her ear.
“No, Claris. You need to swallow it.”
“Hh!”
Claris’s body jumped like Emilia had licked the tip of her pointed ear and she finally sent the saliva back into her throat.
She audibly swallowed it.
Emilia smiled in satisfaction and lay on the bed next to her.
She felt like she had completed a major job.
Kyle stared down at the two of them.
(Lesbians are so hot,) he thought like the moron he was.
They were a princess and her maid, so they were both finely dressed and made for a beautiful image. Plus, they had known each other since they were little, so how was he supposed to avoid having lesbian fantasies about them?
But he refocused his mind and observed just Claris.
He had not had her swallow his saliva via Emilia because he wanted to watch a lesbian kiss.
His saliva carried his recovery magic.
But it only worked if the receiver perceived it as a sexual act with him.
If Claris was sexually interested in Kyle – and thus men in general – the saliva would have some light recovery effect.
But if she was strictly lesbian and had no sexual interest in men at all, this would have no effect.
If the latter, he would just have to give up on her and hope he could find a healer his magic did work on, but…
(What’s this?)
He was shocked when he saw her reaction.
“Ah, hh, wh-what…is this? My body…feels so hot. Hyah!”
The maid was writhing on the bed.
Her green hair was splayed out around her and her apron and skirt were spread out on the bed like a large flower.
Her cheeks were flushed and she twisted her body like something invisible were teasing every last part of her.
“This is…incredible. What is…happening to me? Did you drug me…with something!?”
“No, I didn’t. But this is interesting…”
Claris could barely get the words out she was breathing so heavily and Kyle stated his conclusion based on the evidence.
“Claris, are you attracted to both men and women?”
“Hh, ahh!?”
Her body bent even more in response to his question.
Meanwhile, Emilia’s eyes widened in surprise.
“Um, Kyle? What do you mean she’s attracted to men and women?”
“That’s just how some people are.”
“Is that true, Claris?”
Emilia turned toward the maid who had served her for many long years.
The maid covered her blushing face with both hands and nodded.
“Yes, it is true.”
Emilia gasped.
“Then have you always been attracted to me?”
“N-no!” Claris frantically held Emilia’s arm back with a hand. Her other hand was busy wiping the tears from her eyes. “Well, I cannot deny I have been interested in you…but I assure you I have never held any inappropriate intentions regarding you. …Oh, this is so hard to explain.” Claris sounded frustrated. “I have been watching you all my life and through that I eventually realized I had an attraction to women as well. But ever since that realization, I have made sure I did not view you in that way. You are the princess and you will one day be wed to a nobleman, so my feelings can never be fulfilled. But…” Claris twisted her body a little. “At some point, I realized I was entertaining strange fantasies. I would imagine you sharing a bed with a man, but sometimes I would place myself in the man’s position and other times in your position. I didn’t just fantasize about being with you…so it became clear there was something wrong with me and I liked men and women both.”
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” cut in Kyle. “Liking both men and women is a perfectly normal part of the natural diversity of life. It’s nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear.”
“Baron Vermilion…”
He stroked her tear-streaked cheek and smiled down at her.
“The perversion hidden inside you is something else entirely.”
“Eh? Hyah!?”
Kyle pulled up Claris’s skirt.
Her thighs came into view past the top of her socks. And her underwear was visible past that.
“Princess Emilia, I want you to kiss Claris again. But this time, do it on this mouth.”
“This mouth? You mean…her pussy?”
“Princess Emilia!”
Claris could not believe the princess had used such a dirty word.
But Kyle had already taught Emilia far dirtier words.
“Yes,” confirmed Kyle. “Her recovery point is her clitoris. If you stimulate it while I penetrate her with my cock, we should easily develop her magic circuit.”
“Wait! If you do that…!”
Claris tried to get up, but she found Emilia was already holding her legs down.
“Princess Emilia, not…there!”
“Yours is such a pretty pink.”
Emilia slid the panties aside to reveal her maid’s vulva. She showed no hesitation at all.
She leaned in close and the unique scent of love juices reached her nose.
The pink labia were trembling within that complexly shaped slit, so Emilia spread them with her two index fingers.
“Ah, nh.”
Claris tried to suppress her moan and Emilia continued followed Kyle’s instructions by kissing the clitoris still covered by its hood.
“Hyahhhhhhhhh!”
Claris’s hips shook so hard they nearly bumped into Emilia’s nose, so the princess pulled her head back.
She saw Kyle was holding Claris’s arms in place, so her lower body was the only thing she could still move.
Emilia realized that Claris was just like she had been the first time Kyle had done his recovery magic on her.
Claris was tense with fear of these unfamiliar actions.
Emilia concluded it was her job to rid Claris of that fear.
She held Claris’s legs solidly in place with her arms and pressed her lips against her clitoris again.
“Ahhhhhhhhhhhn!?”
When she squeezed her lips down and sucked on the clit, Claris shouted so loud it sounded like it had to be someone else entirely.
(What is this? If she keeps doing that, I really will go crazy!)
Claris wanted to run away, but Kyle was restraining her upper body and Emilia her lower body. She had no choice but to lie there and let the princess suck her clit.
“Khhhhhhh!”
That awareness of her situation only made the pleasure more powerful.
Once she realized that, she tried not to think about it, but Emilia’s oral attack would not allow it.
“Ah, Princess…Emilia! D-don’t – ah – do that!”
“Why shouldn’t I, Claris?”
“Because- ahhhh!”
“I’m going to keep doing it if you don’t give me a clear answer.”
Emilia planted her lips on the clitoris again and resumed stimulating it.
She finally added her tongue to the mix.
Her soft and warm tongue pressed hard against Claris’s clitoris to lick it.
“Wait, Princess Emilia! That’s too much!”
“That’s still not a good enough answer, Claris.”
“Hh…ahhhhhhh!”
Claris’s body twisted wildly, but Emilia kept going.
The princess seemed so different from her usual gentle self.
But Claris did not find this odd. She knew very well how strong Emilia’s will was. She just rarely showed it.
(This man drew that out of her?)
Claris’s question was driven from her mind by the growing intensity of Emilia’s attack.
“Ha ha. Your clitoris is growing nice and big. I bet I could tease it with my teeth now.”
“Ah, Princess Emilia, wait!”
A hard sensation made Claris’s entire lower body stiffen.
This new stimulation was not a gentle rubbing. It was a lot rougher and cruder and it brought her a hint of fear.
“How do you like that, Claris? I could just bite your clitoris right off.”
“D-don’t do that. Stop teasing me like this.”
“Then tell me where you like to be touched.”
“But…”
“Hmph.”
Emilia squashed Claris’s clit between her teeth.
“Gyaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!?”
Pleasure surged through Claris’s entire body.
She stiffened too much to move as the stimulation to her clitoris was amplified over and over while it ran from the top of her head to the tip of her toes.
“Ah, ahh, Princess…Emilia.”
“So are you ready to tell me now?”
“Yes…I…”
That one attack had melted Claris’s mind, so the words that appeared there spilled unfiltered from her mouth.
“I’m a naughty maid that loves having her clit teased❤ So…so I want both of you to tease it more…and more roughly❤❤”
“Thank you for being honest with me❤” said Emilia, pulling her face away from her maid’s pussy.
She scooped up some of Claris’s love juice from her cheek and chin and licked it from her finger.
“I’ll do lots more for you, so you enjoy it, okay?❤”
Emilia pulled up her skirt and stripped off her underwear.
Then she twirled around and placed her crotch over Claris’s face.
They were now in the 69 position.
“Oh…Princess Emilia…you’re so wet.”
“Because I was licking your pussy, so you had better take responsibility.”
Emilia wiggled her hips, sending nectar dripping from her pussy and onto the maid’s face.
Kyle watched it all from his position above Claris’s head.
From there, he could see Emilia’s vulva and anus quite well.
Spreading her legs to straddle Claris’s head had spread her pussy wider than usual, giving him a view of the pink inside.
Seeing the princess slowly lower her round butt to bring her lewd slit toward Claris’s face, Kyle’s penis throbbed in his slacks.
It was already fully erect.
He wanted so badly to grab Emilia’s butt, penetrate her from behind, and send love juices pouring down on Claris below, but he somehow managed to resist.
His goal here was to develop Claris’s magic circuit.
After removing his slacks and underwear to expose his penis, he circled to their other side.
Now he was by Emilia’s head and could see Claris’s pussy.
“Are you already going to put your cock in Claris’s pussy?”
“I am. It looks like she’s more than ready at this point.”
“Gh, wait, I never said- mh!?”
Claris tried to protest, but Emilia’s covered her mouth with her pussy.
(Ahh, ahh…this is Princess Emilia’s love juices❤)
The love juices flowed into her mouth like she was kissing a spring. She didn’t want to let a single drop escape, so she stuck out her tongue and ran it along Emilia’s vulva.
She spread open the labia with her lips and searched out the vagina with her tongue. But that wasn’t enough for her, so she reached out her hands to pull back the clitoral hood and stimulated the clitoris.
“Ahhn, Claris, that feels wonderful❤”
Pleased by Emilia’s reaction, Claris kept going.
She could have used one hand to reject Kyle, but she felt no real desire to do so.
(Why is that? Because I want it?)
Was she not trying to keep Kyle and his penis away because she wanted a penis in her vagina?
“Nh…ah! A cock is…about to enter me! Wait, I’m sensitive there!”
Emilia guided the penis. She held it between her hands and stroked up and down the shaft while the tip stimulated the entrance of Claris’s vagina.
“Hee hee. I love seeing both of you feeling so much pleasure. Oh, and Kyle’s cock just grew even bigger❤”
“Kh…ah, Princess Emilia, where did you learn that kind of technique?”
Kyle was honestly surprised while he tried to endure this unexpected pleasure.
He had not taught her any means of pleasuring a man. It hadn’t been necessary when his recovery magic required her sexual pleasure, not his own.
Yet now she was moving her hands to stimulate his dick.
“I can do my own research, you know? And I’m not going to let you have the upper hand forever❤”
She opened her mouth wide and took the head of his penis inside.
Kyle’s shaft was pressed against Claris’s vulva while the head was contained in Emilia’s mouth, so he was basically in heaven.
(Really, I only saw Rosetta doing this, so I don’t really know how to do it. I hope this is good enough.)
Emilia stimulated his penis, mimicking what she had seen the knight doing.
She licked the very tip with her tongue tip, squeezed her lips around the base of the head, and sucked.
The princess’s inexperienced blowjob actually provided a new sort of stimulation for Kyle.
“Princess Emilia! That’s…that’s so good. I’m going to cum!”
“You are? Then cum♥ Cum in my mouth♥♥”
She poured all her focus into moving her head back and forth.
She could feel the head of his penis swelling out inside her mouth.
Knowing she was finally about to make Kyle cum, her pussy began to throb and she rubbed it against Claris’s mouth, asking for more oral.
“Agh, Princes…Emilia! I can’t breathe!”
Claris protested, but she did not stop sucking up all of the love juices pouring out of the princess’s vagina.
She licked the vulva pressed hard against her face, she stuck her tongue into the vagina, and she sucked up all the overflowing nectar.
“Ahh♥ You’re rubbing my clit so hard♥”
Kyle’s shaft was pressed against Claris’s clitoris.
And with the head in Emilia’s mouth, her saliva dripped down and coated the clitoris.
A man’s penis rubbed against her clitoris, that penis rubbed her princess’s saliva onto it, and she could drink as much love juices as she wanted straight from her princess’s pussy.
“Ah, I-I’m in heaven♥”
Her lower body shook as a light orgasm hit her. This was not a large wave; it was a gentle pleasure, like rising to the next level. But it acted as a preview of the intense wave that awaited her if this continued.
“Hh, kh, Princess Emilia.”
The small tremor reaching him through Claris’s vulva pushed Kyle even closer to blowing his load, so he pulled his dick from Emilia’s mouth.
A bridge of saliva formed between her lips and the head.
“Huh? Kyle? What is it? Aren’t you going to cum?”
“I can’t boost Claris’s magic circuit if I do it here,” he answered, smiling bitterly.
Of all his recovery magic methods, semen was the best carrier of magic. He could not afford to release all of that in Emilia’s mouth after preparing it for the maid.
“Oh, right. We’re trying to use your magic on Claris,” she said under her breath.
“Princess Emilia?”
Kyle noticed her wavering emotions, but then Emilia looked back up.
She sat up, left her hips in the same place, and squeezed Claris’s head between her thighs.
She took a facesitting position.
“Okay, Claris♥ Kyle is going to fuck your pussy silly with his big, hard cock♥ But you need to ask him for it first♥♥”
With that, Emilia began moving her hips, grinding her clitoris against the maid’s nose and pressing her pussy against the maid’s mouth.
Claris did exactly as Emilia asked.
She first stuck out her tongue for another taste of her princess’s pussy, but then she spread her legs and spread her pussy with her hands.
“Please fuck my pussy♥ Fuck me silly♥ Fuck me until I pass out♥♥♥”
“That can be arranged.”
Kyle brought his swollen cock to Claris’s pussy. He found the vagina without needing to search and he pushed inside.
“Ah, yes♥ There’s a cock inside me♥♥”
“I’m so happy for you, Claris. But you’ve stopped eating me out.”
“Hweh, I’m sorry, Princess Emilia♥ I’ll lick you lots, lots more♥”
￼
Claris’s vagina was tight.
The swollen head of Kyle’s penis was too thick to fit through. He had to move slowly and Claris wiggled her own hips to help loosen herself up inside.
And Emilia demanded the cunnilingus continue throughout.
Claris was forced to work at pleasuring the master at her lower body and the master at her upper body simultaneously.
(Yet one look at her is enough to know she loves this.)
Kyle noted that while entering her slowly enough to avoid hurting her.
Claris’s perversion was not her bisexuality or her love of clitoral stimulation.
It was her longing for a scenario as complex as “being dominated by a man and a woman at the same time”.
Kyle did not know what in her life had led to that desire, but he had been able to bring it to the surface with Emilia’s help.
Yes, it was all Emilia’s doing that he had managed to draw out Claris’s sexual preference.
Without her dominating Claris on his instructions, Claris would never have revealed this buried desire.
He was curious about Emilia’s odd behavior earlier, but boosting Claris’s magic circuit came first.
Kyle focused on his penis.
Claris’s vagina squeezed to stimulate it. The deeper he went, the tighter she got and the more small, bumpy stimulations he could feel on the head. She had an incredible pussy.
He struggled to not blow his load while pushing even deeper.
With the sound of popping love juices, he made it all the way inside her.
“Ahhhhn! Your cock is so deep inside me♥ I can feel it just sitting there inside♥ It’s so hot♥”
The legs the maid always kept modestly closed within her long skirt were now spread indecently wide while she shouted lewd things.
Her ordinarily composed face had melted and was soaked with the love juices dripping from the princess’s pussy.
“Claris, this is who you are. You love being dominated. It turns you on like nothing else. So just be true to yourself. Accept the desires inside you.”
Kyle pulled his hips back and thrusted hard.
He did not hold back like he had before. He pushed all the way through her tight vagina to slam the head against the deepest part.
He also rubbed his pubis against her clit while he was at it.
“Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!? That’s♥ That’s incredibleeeeee♥ Pound that thick thing inside me and my pussy will never close back uuuuuuuup♥♥”
“Claris, don’t you dare enjoy this all on your own. Get that tongue moving.”
“Ahhh, Princess Emilia, I’m sorry♥ I’ll do it♥ I’ll lick you♥”
Claris moved her head to continue eating out Emilia while her hips moved to stir herself up inside with Kyle’s penis.
“Hee hee. Good girl. You deserve a reward♥”
“Hyahhhhhhhh♥ My boooooobs!?”
Emilia suddenly pinched the maid’s nipples through her clothing with perfect precision.
That brought Claris to another light orgasm.
“Yes♥ Yesss! My mouth is having sex with Princess Emilia’s pussy and my pussy is having sex with a cock♥ My entire body is being used for sex♥”
“Isn’t that exactly what you wanted? Doesn’t it feel good to pleasure someone with your mouth and your pussy? It must, given all these love juices flowing from you.”
“Ahh♥ My sex juices won’t stop♥ Because♥ Because it feels so good♥ People are using my mouth pussy and my pussy pussy to get off♥ I…I’m going to cum♥♥”
Claris’s legs trembled as she experienced another light orgasm.
A complex pattern appeared on the skin around her clitoris.
That was the Sex Mark that proved Kyle and Claris’s magic circuits were linked.
With that link established, he only had to ejaculate.
“Ahh, that’s so good. Your vagina is moving in the most wonderful way. I’m going to cum in no time.”
“Kyle, this is weird. I feel like something is going to come out of me too.”
Emilia leaned forward and reached out to grab his hand.
He took her hand and supported her.
“That probably means you’re about to squirt. It’s similar to a man’s ejaculation, although not quite the same. This just shows how much you’re enjoying Claris’s mouth.”
“Princess Emilia, you’re enjoying my mouth?”
Claris reacted to Kyle’s explanation and her vagina began moving even more.
That increased the stimulation to Kyle’s penis as well.
All three of them were enhancing each other’s emotions and creating even greater arousal.
That three-way link allowed them all to climax at the same time.
“Kh, I’m going to cum. I’m going to fill Claris’s maid pussy with my white cum!”
“Ahh, me too! I’m going to squirt. I’m going to squirt inside Claris’s mouth pussy!”
“Please do♥ White or clear, cover my body with your sex juices♥ I want them all♥”
Kyle’s penis shook as it shot semen inside Claris’s vagina.
At the same time, a clear and less sticky fluid squirted from Emilia’s pussy and down onto Claris’s face.
“Hyahhhhhhhhhhhhh♥♥ Yesssssssss♥ You’re cumming so much into both my pussies♥ Thank youuuuuuuu♥♥♥♥♥”
Claris’s entire body shook atop the bed.
She could feel how much her vagina was squeezing from the great pleasure.
She could tell the rhythmic squeezing was working at Kyle’s cock as if to milk even more semen from it.
Her mouth opened and closed in search of the soft sensation from before, but she found it was gone.
Instead, Emilia lowered her face and kissed Claris again.
“Excellent work, Claris. It looks like the magic was a success.”
“Princess…Emilia…thank you…”
Claris’s strength ran out and her eyes shut.
“Oh, she fell asleep.”
“She had never done anything like that, so it must have worn her out.”
Kyle pulled his penis from the maid who had fallen asleep with her legs spread indecently wide.
The head pulled some of the milky fluid out with it.
“…”
Emilia silently stared at the cum spilling from the maid’s vagina.
“Is something wrong, Emilia?”
“No, nothing…”
Emilia rapidly shook her head.
She really was acting weirdly.
But before he could ask anything more, she raised her head and asked a question of her own.
“So will this boost Claris’s magic?”
He was still curious about her odd behavior, but he chose to answer her question instead.
“It will. I guarantee it.” He spoke with certainty in his voice. “Now there is no way we can lose to the dark elves.”
Elf Harem Chapter 6: Confession and Showdown – Please Cum Inside Me!
“Claris, we need your recovery magic!”
“Right away.”
The rescue elf spoke up as soon as she entered the tent.
She sounded panicked, but the maid’s response was unnervingly calm.
The green-haired maid standing in the center of the tent shut her eyes and recited an incantation.
 
“Spirits, hear my call. My name is Claris, the one bound to you by contract.
“Spirits, gather here and grant me your power. My name is Claris, the one who wishes to seed her healing power.
“Spirits, Claris seeks your power, so please grant it!”
 


A warm light grew from her.
The light spread past the tent to reach the many other tents in the area.
And…
“Oh, my arm is healed!”
“Same here! I can walk again!”
“We can return to the fight now!”
The elf soldiers brought down by injury rose to their feet one after another.
They received new orders and returned to the battlefield.
This was the true power of Claris’s recovery magic.
The magical effect was not all that powerful and it could only heal minor wounds, but its range had grown considerably after the boost to her magic circuit. With just one incantation, she had healed nearly 500 injured soldiers at once.
 
The dark elf army gathered in the mountains surrounding the royal capital were routed by an attack from the Finegard army.
The attack had been made when the dark elves were close to having the numbers needed to attack the capital, so their plan was entirely ruined.
The dark elves regrouped and resisted the royal army, but they were up against a tough opponent. Plus, the injured soldiers were healed and sent back out almost immediately, so the attack never let up.
Eventually, the dark elves were driven from the mountains and into the field east of the capital.
They were sitting ducks for magical attacks in that open space.
The dark elves were certain they would be forced into retreat by the same lightning magic as before.
Until their reinforcements arrived, that is.
 
With the flash of lighting and rumble of thunder, the royal army was forced to retreat.
Emilia, Rosetta, Kyle, the prime minister, and so many other nobles were gathered in the strategy room when a messenger rushed in.
“I-I have a report. After the dark elf army received minimal reinforcements, our unit was hit by powerful lightning magic and our army was routed. The entire army has retreated within the capital’s walls.”
“What did you say!?”
The nobles raised their voices in protest, but Emilia silenced them.
“Is everyone okay!? What about Claris?”
“I am fine, Princess Emilia.”
The green-haired maid stepped into the strategy room.
Her usually impeccable maid uniform was ripped and stained, but she had no apparent injuries.
“Thank goodness.” Emilia breathed a sigh of relief.
“The dark elves sent a warning,” said Claris, as if her own condition was of secondary importance.
“The message was sent by wind transmission magic, so everyone heard it. Some of the people in the capital heard it too, so confusion is spreading.”
“Enough preamble. What did the dark elves say?” demanded a noble, so the messenger hurriedly relayed the message.
“ ‘My name is Roxene, the one who seeks the liberation of all dark elves, the true chosen people of the spirits. I come bearing a message for your tyrannical kingdom. If you do not surrender and hand over control of your capital in one day’s time, you will be subject to another lightning strike that shall reduce your city to rubble like the wrath of god.’ ”
“Roxene?”
The nobles sounded shaken by the messenger’s report. Some even paled.
“Um, who is Roxene?” Kyle whispered to Emilia.
A sharp-eared noble overheard him and raised his voice.
“An uneducated country boy like you might not be aware, but Roxene is the treasonous dark elf who plotted to assassinate the king 3000 years ago!”
Emilia waved a hand to silence the noble and took over the explanation for him.
“Roxene wields such powerful magic he is said to rival my father who was called a great mage. He was one of the few dark elves to earn his trust and be granted entrance to the palace. But…he betrayed that trust and attempted to usurp the throne.”
“His Majesty repelled him at the time,” said the prime minister. “Not even he was a match for His Majesty, so he was badly injured and forced to flee. I had thought he was long dead…”
And now that man was here?
Had Roxene been commanding the dark elf attacks of late? He must have received word of the king’s death and decided to use the resultant confusion for an attack.
“The audacity!” roared one of the nobles, punching his chair’s armrest in anger.
Another noble furrowed his brow and spoke to Emilia.
“This was a complete surprise, wasn’t it? We were supposed to be waiting for the dark elves to surrender, but now the tables have turned. We have no defense against that lightning magic. What is your plan, princess?”
“Well…”
Emilia did not have an immediate answer.
This man was one who had been suspicious of the king’s absence all along. A poor answer here and he would use it as an excuse to demand an audience with the king and thus reveal the king’s death.
That would lead to complete chaos. This man and the other nobles might even attempt to take control of the kingdom for themselves.
(What do I do?)
Emilia was unsure of herself.
Kyle took a step forward and spoke on her behalf.
“This is not a problem at all. Princess Emilia will overpower that lightning magic with her own.”
“K-Kyle?”
She panicked hearing that.
She had not seen the earlier attack for herself, but based on the boom that had rattled the entire castle and the fact that the elite royal army had been instantly forced to retreat, she knew it had to be far greater than her own.
She couldn’t possibly overpower it.
“Can she really do that?”
But Kyle answered the noble man’s skepticism with a firm nod.
“Of course. I guarantee it.”
 
They took a temporary break from the meeting so everyone could organize their own troops’ equipment.
But they knew some of the nobles were sure to secretly flee the capital. The situation was even worse than when the dark elves attacked before.
Emilia took Kyle back to her room.
Rosetta was patrolling the castle with her soldiers and Claris was receiving a medical checkup and then getting some rest.
Kyle was essentially Emilia’s bodyguard and aide at the moment.
He had been looking glum ever since the meeting ended. He hadn’t said a word to Emilia on the way here.
Seeing that felt like confirmation of the worries Emilia had been carrying all this time.
(Kyle…is that how you feel about me?)
But she could not bring herself to say it out loud and simply sat on her bed.
She normally would have had Claris take down her hair before she visited the bath, but not today.
She considered going straight to sleep, but then Kyle suddenly spoke.
“Your Highness…”
“Oh, yes? What is it?”
She responded in surprise, but then she felt a further shock. Your Highness! Why was he being so formal all of a sudden?
“Forgive me, Your Highness. I spoke out of turn during the meeting.”
“You have nothing to apologize for. You only said that because you know a way for me to overpower that lightning magic, don’t you?”
“Well…”
He awkwardly looked away.
This again. She was furious.
It felt like he had gone back to how he was when they first met. They were no longer Kyle and Emilia – they were a noble and a princess. They were only ranks and roles with no personal knowledge of each other.
“What is wrong, Kyle!?” she shouted. “Be open with me. What do you have to hide after everything? Is there really something you can’t tell me? What happened to the man who came out of nowhere to say he had to have sex with me, surprised me with a kiss, and m-made my body so l-lewd?”
“Princess Emilia…”
When she said all that in a single breath, his eyes widened and he looked at her again.
Then he smiled a little and bowed.
“I apologize. I will tell you.” He looked her straight in the eye. “To be blunt, there is only one way for you to overpower that lightning magic: to boost your magic circuit.”
“Boost my magic circuit…”
“Yes. I have already used my magic to increase the quantity and quality of your magic. Taking that any further would require lengthy training. So the only option is to boost your magic circuit itself to increase the amount of magic you can use at one time.”
“Is that…the same thing you did to Claris the other day?”
“It is. Which means…” He nodded and explained what they would have to do. “I would need to cum inside you.”
“…Ah!”
Cum inside.
Emilia felt a squeezing deep in her stomach when she heard those words.
But she kept the reaction from her face and asked a question.
“Why were you so hesitant to bring this up? You already did it with Claris.”
“Because that was my first time using my recovery magic on her. But your body has already been linked to my magic circuit. You have the Sex Mark, remember? If I cum in you with that link in place, it will increase the effects of the magic circuit boosting, but at the same time, um…”
“Yes?”
“It makes, um…conception exceedingly likely.”
“Oh, my.”
Emilia was honestly surprised to hear this.
She had intellectually known it was a possibility, but it took him saying it out loud for her to be consciously aware of it.
She had Kyle had been having sex, an act used to make babies.
“What is your point exactly? I mean, if we are having sex, of course I could get pregnant. I fail to see the problem.”
“We can’t do that!” shouted Kyle. He bowed deeply, becoming nothing more than a baron once more. “I…am a poor rural noble and you are the princess who carries the weight of Finegard on your shoulders. Our stations are too different. We could not possibly have a child.”
“Kyle…”
“I have only been casting recovery magic on you. Once the kingdom has overcome these challenging times, my services will no longer be needed. You must not create that sort of connection with someone like that.”
“Kyle…stop.”
“But…there are several ways of avoiding it. There is a drug you can take beforehand that makes it harder to conceive. There is also a drug you can take after the fact. Do not worry. I have no intention of having a child with royalty like you.”
“Stop this!”
Emilia hopped down from the bed and pushed Kyle onto his back.
He stared up at her in shock as she held his head to the floor and forcibly kissed him.
She sucked at the lips that had always so aggressively filled her mouth with its saliva and she filled his mouth with her tongue.
“Ah, nh…Your Highness, what!?”
She only released his lips after he had swallowed plenty of her saliva.
He looked confounded, so she glared down at him as she answered him.
“Kyle, is this why you would never cum inside me?”
“Eh? Well, um…” He awkwardly looked away but then nodded. “Yes. I resisted out of fear I might get you pregnant.”
“So it wasn’t because you don’t like me or I’m not your type?”
“Eh? Of course not. If anything, I love-”
He quickly clamped his mouth shut to avoid finishing that sentence.
Him blushing and looking away was the opposite of their usual interactions.
And she couldn’t help but laugh when she saw it.
“Pff. Ah ha ha ha!”
“Your Highness?”
“Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha!”
Emilia held her sides and laughed on top of surprised Kyle.
All of her worries felt so silly now.
And now that she knew the truth, she did not hesitate.
“Kyle, you don’t have to worry about that.”
“What do you mean?”
“Do you remember Finegard I’s prophecy I told you about?”
Wise King Finegard I, founder of the kingdom, had made several prophecies that were passed down by the elves as legends.
One of them was as follows: “When the wise king falls and a crisis befalls the kingdom, one with miraculous healing powers shall arrive, inherit the throne, and save the kingdom.”
“If the one with healing powers is you, Kyle, then us having a child so we could share the throne would only be fulfilling the prophecy.”
“B-but that’s only a legend.”
“But more important than that! I am the princess! And I want it!”
“Princess Emilia…”
“I want you to do whatever you want to me. I want you to make me cum and I want to make you cum. And I want some proof of it. So…so…”
She worked to suppress the throbbing urge deep in her stomach.
She knew the Sex Mark, the current proof of her link with Kyle, had to be glowing with a pulsing light.
“I want you to fill me with lots and lots of cum to knock me up❤❤❤”
 
Kyle disrobed and climbed onto the bed.
Emilia was already lying there with her milky skin exposed.
He gasped anew at her beauty.
Her slender limbs were as perfect as a sculpture. Her large breasts were squished down ever so slightly by gravity, but they mostly maintained their shape with the small pink nipples cutely erect.
Her slender waist drew a flowing curve out to her thick butt. Between her slightly spread legs, her pussy was already wet and waiting for someone to enter it.
And the complex shape of the Sex Mark glowed above that.
She gasped when her blue eyes landed on a certain part of his body.
His penis had twitched in response to viewing her body.
He smiled bitterly.
“I don’t think this guy can wait much longer.”
“Neither…can I.”
With a somewhat sulky tone, she reached both hands down between her legs.
She spread her legs, spread her labia with her index fingers, and pulled back the skin covering her clitoris with her thumbs, revealing the shape of her vulva to Kyle.
It was all so wet he thought he heard a sticky sound as she spread it and he saw her small vagina trembling as if to ask for his dick.
“Hurry…hurry, Kyle❤”
“Of course, Emilia.”
He moved between her legs, supported his penis with one hand, and slowly moved his hips forward to place the head against her vagina.
“Here I go.”
“Yes, yes, yes❤”
She did not need any extra lubricant or foreplay.
His penis entered her vagina without any difficulty.
But the path inside was by no means loose. It squeezed him stronger and tighter than ever before to give him pleasure.
It was like she wanted him to ejaculate as soon as possible.
“Kh, your pussy is incredible. It’s so hot, tight, and amazing.”
“Yes❤ So is your cock❤ It’s pushing my pussy open❤ And knocking on me from the inside❤❤”
“I’m going to start moving.”
“Move❤ Move as much and as hard as you want❤ Use my body to get off❤❤”
He felt the base of his penis grow wet in no time.
Emilia was releasing love juices at an incredible rate.
He thrusted his hips harder than ever before, just like she had asked him to. He remembered to rub at the g-spot she liked best even as he moved his hips to bring himself to climax.
“Ah, ah, yes❤ You’re pounding me so hard❤❤ I can feel it in my hips❤ It’s like you’re pounding at my entire body at once❤ Yes, yesss❤❤”
“Kh, your pussy is going crazy. How much do you like this?”
When he moved his hips, the entire length of her vaginal walls would squeeze at him.
It felt so good he kept speeding up his hips.
“Ah, wow, ahh❤ I’m cumming❤ I’m already cumming❤ I’m cumming before you❤”
She draped her arms around his neck and placed her legs around his back to hold onto him with all four limbs.
She was partially restraining him, but his thrusting only picked up speed.
The sticky sound of love juices and the slapping of flesh against flesh filled the room.
When he pulled his hips back as far as he could, her vaginal entrance would squeeze at the head.
When he thrusted in as deep as he could, her vaginal walls would cover the entire length of his penis.
He enjoyed both the intensity and the softness while thrusting harder, faster, and longer.
“Ahhh! I’m cumming❤ Your cock is making me cuuuuum❤❤”
“I’m close too. I’m going to fill your princess pussy with my cum.”
“Fill my pussy with lots and lots of cum and knock me up❤❤❤❤❤”
The head swelled out and her vagina squeezed even harder in response.
His penis trembled while pumping semen inside her vagina.
Every time it throbbed, more of it would shoot out.
The ejaculation just kept going and he pressed his hips against her to make extra sure the semen was getting inside her.
￼
“Yes…yes❤ So this is what it feels like❤ I can feel your cock shooting sperm inside me❤”
Emilia writhed in pleasure.
When Kyle finally pulled out of her, a white thread connected the tip of the head to her vagina. That was a mixture of his semen and her love juices.
She went limp when she saw it.
A strange fulfillment filled her body.
She felt like going to sleep right there, but she was also filled with so much energy she could have redone all her work for the day.
“Oh…”
“What is it, Emilia?”
“Look at the Sex Mark.”
She spread her legs again and pointed at the mark on her lower stomach.
It was glowing brighter than ever before.
“Will it not disappear now?”
“Do you not want it to?”
“Of course I don’t!” She raised her voice without meaning to and immediately blushed. “That is to say…um, the others’ don’t disappear, right? So I was wondering why only mine did.”
“Oh…”
The other three’s Sex Marks had been more solidly established when he sent semen full of his magic into the focal point of their magic circuit, so their Marks were always visible.
Rosetta’s was on her cheek, so it was especially noticeable.
Kyle gently embraced Emilia.
“Kyle?”
“I’m sorry, Emilia. I didn’t realize how I was making you feel.”
She was a princess.
He was a poor rural noble.
So he had decided to never cross that line with her.
But he had not considered how that would make her feel.
“Your Mark is permanent now. Unless you use magic specifically designed to get rid of it.”
“Kyle, I’m so happy.”
She hugged him back.
After sharing each other’s warmth for a while, she spoke up again.
“By the way…has my magic circuit been boosted now? I don’t feel any different.”
“Um, no…not yet,” he responded awkwardly. “Your magic circuit is tougher than I was expecting. That is a good thing, of course, but it means I will need to fill you with more of my magic to boost it.”
“By your magic…you mean your semen, don’t you?”
“I do.”
“How many more times?”
“Another…5 times, I think.”
“Oh, my.”
She gasped.
She needed him to cum inside her five more times tonight.
Just imagining it filled her body with that throbbing sensation again.
“I fail to see the problem, Kyle. The night is still young, after all.”
“Emilia?”
She was already breathing heavily.
She pointed toward her vagina full of semen and love juices with one hand and reached the other hand out to him in invitation.
“Please use me to get off lots, lots more❤”
 
A wet, rhythmic sound echoed through a steamy and humid room.
The room was the bath adjacent to Emilia’s room.
Her maid would always prepare her an evening bath in there.
This was a private bath, not the palace’s main bath. It was only a tiled room containing a bathtub a bit larger than an average Japanese household bath.
But it was still large enough to hold two.
Kyle lay on his back, soaking in the tub, while Emilia was crouching by his legs lifting his hips with her hands.
His penis was sticking halfway above the water like a submarine periscope and she was stroking up and down it with her lips.
It had started with her wanting to wash all the cum out of her hair.
That had led to both of them washing off their sweat, then they had both soaked in the tub, and the next thing either of them knew, this was happening.
“Ah, kh, god, you give good head, Emilia.”
“Nhh, good, I have your cock hard again♥”
She sounded delighted and then she resumed the blowjob.
Whenever her lips touched the water, some of it would get into her mouth and she used that as a lubricant to ensure the stimulation was never too strong.
“Ugh, Emilia. I’m going to cum if you keep this up.”
“Then go ahead and cum❤ Fill my mouth with it❤ Then I can spit it into the water so we can soak in a semen bath❤❤”
“That sounds lovely, but we have a job to complete tonight.”
He quickly stood up, pulling his penis out of her mouth.
“Ahn.”
“Over here, Emilia.”
He picked up the princess and carried her from the tub to the mantlepiece by the wall.
There was a brick fireplace there, but there was no fire in it at the moment. He placed a cloth on the narrow space and placed her on it.
“Eh? Um, what is this?”
“Are you really going to get embarrassed now after everything we’ve done?”
Her back was pressed against the wall with just her butt on top of the narrow mantlepiece and her legs spread wide and lifted high.
“Whew, you sure are wet. Were you dripping with love juices the entire time you sucked my dick?”
“…Yes.”
She tried to look away in embarrassment, but that was difficult in such a narrow space.
She had to continue watching him observe her dripping pussy.
“Um…stop looking and put it inside me❤”
“Yes, of course. If my horny princess demands a hard cock in her pussy, then her wish is my command.”
“Don’t put it like that…ahn❤”
He pushed his penis inside her.
His hips were a little lower than the hole this time, so he felt like he was thrusting up into her.
The head rubbed along the upper wall of her vagina, providing her with a ticklish pleasure.
“Ah, yes, I love this❤ It’s like you keep knocking on me❤❤”
“Kh, Emilia. I’m going to cum! This is #2. Take it inside you.”
“Ahh❤ Yes❤ I want more of your cum in my lower mouth❤❤”
He filled her pussy with his semen a second time.
“Incredible❤ There’s just as much as the first time❤❤”
She twisted her body on the narrow mantlepiece.
When he pulled out of her, a white thread dripped down from her vagina to the head. That was a mixture of his semen and her love juices.
“Oh, what a waste.”
She reached down to keep it inside her and lost her balance.
She pitched forward and he caught her.
“Calm down, Emilia.”
“But I don’t want to waste any of your semen❤”
“I appreciate it, but you don’t have to worry. We’ll be doing this four more times.”
“Oh, that’s right❤”
Four more times.
Imagining that level of pleasure four more times nearly made her cum again.
 
“Ah, wait, Kyle. This pose is embarrassing.”
“You’re easily embarrassed tonight.”
“Anyone would be…”
After he lowered her from the mantlepiece, she thought he was going to lay her down on her back, but he instead held her around the hips and placed her on all fours.
“We’ve done it from behind once already, remember?”
“That was completely different. This makes me feel like an animal.”
It probably didn’t help that there was a large mirror in front of her, so she could see what she looked like doing this.
“We’re having sex six times in one night. We basically are animals.”
“Ah, hyahh❤”
Without warning, his penis pushed all the way inside her.
Her vagina had been so loosened by the last two times that barely any foreplay was necessary. She only had to sit there feeling it moving in and out of her.
“Ah❤ Ah❤ That’s amazing❤ It feels so much stronger than before❤ It’s like my body is going to break to pieces❤❤”
“C’mon, look at yourself in the mirror. See what you look like getting fucked.”
“Ah, ahhhh❤”
She looked up as told and saw her face melting like ice, her four limbs on the floor, her hips lifted high, and a man pounding on her pussy from behind.
“That’s❤ That’s me?❤ That’s me on all fours like a dog?❤ And getting pounded by Kyle?❤❤”
“It is.”
He slapped her ass with the palm of his hand.
There was barely any pain, but it sent a shock through her lower body.
“Nhhh❤❤”
“You’re a princess, but you stripped down for a man!” Slap! “You shook your hips to ask for it!” Slap! “And you’re moaning while you take his cock!” Slap!
“Ahn❤ Ahh❤ But❤ But it feels so good❤ Your cock feels so good❤ I can’t help it❤ I want your cum❤ So I’ll do it like a dog if I have to❤❤❤”
“Then start moving your hips. Rub my cock and make me cum a third time.”
“Ahh, okay❤ Like this? Is this good enough?❤”
She moved her hips to rub her pussy up and down his penis. And she failed to realize this was several times lewder than just letting him thrust inside her.
“Ah, I’m cumming. I’m cumming a third time.”
“Yes❤ Yes, yes, yes❤ Fill me with your doggy style cum❤❤”
He shot out just as much semen as the last two times.
Her exhausted arms bent and she rested her head on them like a pillow while she caught her breath in satisfaction.
 
“Ahhh❤ This is so wonderful❤ My pussy is never going to be the same❤❤”
Emilia was moaning while lying nearly on her side.
Kyle held her left leg which was resting on his shoulder. Their legs were intertwined in a cross shape while he thrusted inside her to stimulate her in a different place than before.
“Ah❤ Ahn❤ Yes, I love it there❤”
“Here? Or here?”
He moved his hips around to send his penis all over her vagina.
Every time, it sent a tingling pleasure through her body.
“I love them both❤ It feels so good❤ You haven’t shot your semen there yet, so please cum there this time❤ I want you to cover every bit of my vagina with your cum❤”
“Kh, I can’t do much else when you squeeze like that. Okay, Emilia. I’m going to cum.”
“Yes❤ Fill me up a fourth time❤❤❤”
His penis throbbed as a milky liquid surged from the tip.
The intensity of his ejaculations showed no sign of waning.
 
“Ahhhhn❤ Yes, yesssss❤ I love it on my cervix❤”
This time, Kyle lay on his back while Emilia moved her hips on top of him. Those movements were so seductive his weary penis was back in business just from watching it.
And the squeezing of her vagina was still going strong.
Her pussy held onto his penis like it refused to let him escape before morning.
“Ahh❤ Your cock just got bigger again❤ That means you’re still enjoying my pussy, doesn’t it?❤”
She moved her hips so the tip of the head would hit her as deep as it could go. She could feel the head covered in some remaining sticky semen hitting her in that deep pleasure point.
“Ahn❤ I want your cock even harder than that❤ Kyle, move my body❤ Use me to get off❤❤”
“Excuse me, then.”
He grabbed her hips and lifted them.
She was supporting herself with her legs, so it was not a difficult task.
After lifting her, he lowered her hard. He also thrusted his hips up to penetrate her deep.
“Nhhhhhhhhhh❤ Yes❤ That’s what I wanted❤ It feels like you’re penetrating me all the way to the top of my head❤ Harder❤ Pound me even harder❤❤”
“Do you like it a little rough?”
“I like it either way❤ Because you’re so good at this❤ You can make me feel so good when you try❤ And I love iiiiiit❤❤”
Her hips shook and her upper body collapsed toward him.
“But❤ I also like it when you just use me to get off❤ I love it when you cum❤ I love it when my body makes you feel good❤❤❤”
She held him tight in her arms.
Her vagina held his penis just as tight.
And she moved her hips up and down all the while.
“So cum❤❤ Cum even more❤❤ Cum over and over in my pussy❤ Cum until there’s no room left in my body for more cum❤ Remake my body until it’s made of cum❤❤❤”
“…Emilia.”
He held her tight too.
And he moved his own hips.
Their hip movements synchronized as they sought the most possible pleasure.
Her vagina squeezed tight around his penis.
The tip of the head pounded on her cervix, sending jolts of pleasure through her vagina, womb, and the rest of her body.
“I’m going to cum, Emilia. This is #5.”
“Yes❤ Give me your sperm❤ I want more, more, more❤ Lots and lots and lots❤ I want your cock inside me forever❤ I want you to fuck me until my pussy is permanently shaped like your cock❤ Fill me with so much cum it can’t fit inside meeeeeee❤❤❤❤❤”
 
Kyle’s penis throbbed again and filled Emilia’s vagina with more semen.
“That’s, um, how many times now?”
“Twelve❤❤”
Kyle had lost count, but Emilia had not.
He pulled his penis out of her.
It had been a while since he had kept cumming inside her over and over without pulling out.
“Wow…look at all that cum dripping from your pussy.”
“Hee hee. Because you filled me with so much of it❤ I feel like I’m pregnant already❤❤”
She rubbed her stomach. She felt like semen would flood out of her vagina if she pushed on her stomach. That was just how many times he had cummed inside her.
“So has that boosted my magic circuit?”
“Yes. You have nothing to worry about now. Your lightning magic should be even more powerful than Roxene’s. In fact, I bet it will be the most powerful lightning magic in history.”
“Thank goodness. Now I can save Finegard.”
“Let’s take a break.”
He rubbed the princess’s golden hair while making that suggestion, but she grabbed his hand.
“What is it, Emilia?”
“The night isn’t over yet, Kyle.”
“Eh?”
She sat up with her eyes shining bright…and glistening lewdly.
He even thought he saw a heart-sharped light shining deep in those eyes.
“You don’t have to cum inside me anymore and that opens up a lot more options.”
“Um, what do you mean?”
“I know you keep filling Rosetta’s mouth with your cum. And let’s not forget that dark elf prisoner’s b-butt.”
“Y-you saw that?”
“I did.”
She held him tight and then moved her face toward his lower body. His penis had finally run out of energy, but she supported it with both hands and placed her lips around the head.
It soon began to grow once more.
“See?❤ You can keep going❤” She lovingly rubbed her cheek against his erection. “My body still wants more of your cum, so how about you use a different hole this time?❤❤❤”
￼




 
The following day, Emilia viewed the eastern plains from the castle balcony.
Just like the day before, the dark elf army had a unit there waiting for the moment to strike.
“Do you see him, Princess Emilia?”
Kyle and the prime minister accompanied her on the balcony. So did Rosetta and a few more bodyguard knights. The nobles were watching from inside.
Emilia answered Kyle’s question with a nod.
“Yes, I do. That man riding an impressive steed at the center of the dark elf army must be Roxene.”
Kyle could see him too.
That great mage was 5000 years old, just like the king had been, but he had the look of a powerful warrior.
He wore heavy armor that left only his face exposed. Long gray hair and a gray beard covered a wrinkled face that still carried a great strength of will.
That ancient elf was the one whose lightning magic had driven back Finegard’s army and who had demanded the capital surrender.
Magic seemed to gather around him. Emilia and Rosetta were not trained to see magic, but they could still sense a stagnant and oppressive pressure coming from him.
“Cast your most powerful lightning at that point. You can do this now.”
“…Yes, I can.”
Emilia agreed with Kyle.
She held her staff tight and spoke her incantation.
 
“Spirits, hear my call. My name is Emilia, the one bound to you by contract.
“Spirits, gather here and grant me your power. My name is Emilia, the one who wishes to seed her lightning power.
“Spirits, Emilia seeks your power, so please grant it!”
 
Once her incantation was complete, she held her staff aloft.
With a deafening noise, a section of the sky distorted and filled with bright light.
The light threatened to scorch the eyes of all who saw it and it soon dropped toward the center of the dark elf army where Roxene was preparing to make one last demand for Finegard’s surrender.
 
Roxene sensed the magic attack directed at him and immediately swung his staff.
He rapidly recited an incantation, surrounding himself with lightning magic to defend himself.
Emilia’s magic crashed into his magic barrier.
Blinding light covered the plain, the capital, and the sky.
“Khhhhh!”
“Princess Emilia!”
Emilia groaned in pain as the magic rushed back at her, pushing her backwards.
Kyle supported her.
“Kyle…”
“Don’t worry. I promise that you can win.”
“…Of course.”
She raised her staff again.
Just like her father had once driven out this man to save the kingdom millennia ago.
To reclaim peace, she launched every bit of her magic at that historical foe.
And.
Emilia’s boosted magic broke through Roxene’s magic barrier.
With nothing left in its way, her lightning crashed down on the dark elf mage.
Roxene’s raised right arm was vaporized and he was knocked from his horse.
The dark elf army was shaken by their leader’s injury.
At that very moment, the capital’s tightly-shut gate burst open and Finegard’s army rushed out to attack.
Roxene had already lost all will to fight.
With their leader gone, more and more of the dark elves threw down their weapons and surrendered.
The battle was over in less than an hour.
 
And that is the story of how a dark elf rebellion attempted shortly after the king’s tragic death was stopped with the help of a poor rural noble by the name of Baron Vermilion.

Elf Harem Epilogue: I Turned the Elf Palace into a Happy Harem
One month later, a grand coronation ceremony was held in Finegard’s capital.
The king’s funeral was complete and the period of mourning over, so the people celebrated their new ruler without any sorrow.
Traditionally, Finegard’s new monarchs were given their crown by a priest in the Spirit Chapel. It acted as a sign that god had granted them their power.
After the coronation, the monarch would ride a carriage down the capital’s main street to reach the royal palace while the people cheered. Their official duties would begin once they were inside the palace.
But on this day, the people witnessed an unprecedented coronation.
This time, there were two new monarchs riding the carriage to the palace.
One was Emilia Finegard, daughter of the previous king.
The other former Baron Kyle Vermilion, who had married her shortly before the coronation.
According to elf legend, “When the wise king falls and a crisis befalls the kingdom, one with miraculous healing powers shall arrive, inherit the throne, and save the kingdom.”
That prophecy came from Finegard I, the kingdom’s very first king.
His prophecies held real weight and many traditions had been set aside to ensure they came true in the past. The elves did the same this time.
Kyle had used his recovery magic to heal the princess and many others and ultimately saved the kingdom from the dark elf attack, so some had tried to give him the throne now that it was vacant.
But the nobles had of course vehemently protested.
And Kyle himself had refused to simply take the throne for himself.
Then someone had suggested a joint rule.
Kyle could marry Emilia to join the Finegard royal family and then they could take the throne together.
Some delicate agreements had been necessary to convince the nobles and avoid any complications regarding succession, but it had worked out in the end.
Now that the dark elves had lost their rebellious leader, Lielle had been freed and used as a special envoy with her people. They had ultimately reached terms of peace.
They had been enemies for so long that it would take time before everything was worked out, but they had taken the first step toward true peace.
The carriage carrying the new queen and king passed through the palace’s front gate to great cheers.
The cacophony was still audible after the gate closed behind it.
The celebration was sure to continue for another week at least.
But the carriage left all that noise behind as it passed through the courtyard and approached a detached section of the palace.
“Congratulations, Queen Emilia and King Kyle.”
A green-haired maid – Claris – awaited them in front of that section.
“Thank you, Claris.”
“I’m exhausted after all that.”
The two of them removed their cloaks and handed them to the maid. Their ceremonial garb was extremely heavy thanks to all the ornamentation. Claris handed them to another maid, told her where to put them, and then guided Kyle and Emilia.
“Is everything ready?”
“Yes. I did precisely as you asked. …But are you sure you do not want to rest first?”
“Absolutely sure.” Emilia nodded. “This is our duty as queen and king.”
 
The detached section was where Kyle had stayed throughout the dark elf crisis.
It had since been remodeled into a permanent residence.
“Wow,” gasped Kyle when Claris showed him into the room.
This was a bedroom.
But nearly half of the area was covered by a bed. This was not just king size; it was two or even three times larger.
Two women were already lying in it.
One was Rosetta, the knight with fiery red hair.
The other was Lielle, the dark elf with brown skin.
“Took you long enough, Kyle.”
“Right? We were just about to get started on our own.”
“W-we were not! I am not interested in you that way!”
“Really, Rosetta? The way you kept looking at my chest suggests otherwise.”
“I can’t help that when your clothes barely even cover your boobs!”
Kyle interrupted those two lest their bickering continue forever.
“Calm down, you two. I will be giving all of you the attention you deserve.”
He then called Emilia and Claris over.
“Are you ready to get started?”
“Um, yes…”
“Excuse me.”
They hesitantly but eagerly agreed.
Soon, all five of them were in the bed.
 
Converting Kyle’s detached area into a harem had been Emilia’s idea.
Elves had a much harder time reproducing than humans.
If the royals were too picky about bloodline, they would rapidly run out of heirs. Thus, it had become traditional for them to have as many children as possible, even if they were not the king and queen’s direct offspring. All of Finegard’s past kings had kept several concubines.
It would of course be Emilia and Kyle’s child that inherited the throne after them.
But that child would need helpers and possibly even a parent for the generation after that.
 
“Ahh, hh❤ Kyle, please❤ I need more than your fingers❤ Let me suck your cock❤❤”
Rosetta begged him with strings of drool dripping from the corners of her mouth and her tongue.
“N-no fair❤ I want it in my ass first❤ I’ve only gotten his tongue so far❤❤”
Lielle stuck out her large brown butt while trembling so much it looked like it should be audible.
“Nhh❤ King Kyle…that’s too strong❤ You’re going to tear my nipple right off❤❤”
Claris did not stop rubbing her clit with her legs spread wide.
“Kyle❤ My pussy❤ My pussy wants – no, needs – your cock right now❤❤”
Emilia roughly rubbed his erect penis with desire coursing through her body.
The bedroom had grown steamy in only five minutes.
The four women showed Kyle how ready their bodies were for him while their faces melted with lust, so his heart was pounding with excitement.
A complex mark resembling a dungeon map appeared on each of them at different spots.
Kyle gently rubbed each of them as he answered.
“Calm down. I will give you each a turn. We have plenty of time, after all.”
He first brought his penis to the redheaded knight’s mouth.
“Here, you can suck this.”
“Yes❤ I finally get your cock in my mouth❤”
Rosetta swallowed its full length, bringing the head deep into her throat. She was having trouble breathing, but he knew she was never satisfied without suffocating herself on his dick. He grabbed her head and roughly moved it back and forth just the way she liked it.
Her entire body shook with pleasure as his cock fucked her throat. Her fingers reached toward her crotch and started rubbing at her pussy.
“Okay, I’m going to cum.”
“Abh❤ Bhhhhh❤ Wow❤ So much cum in my mouth❤ And the smell❤❤❤❤❤”
His penis was still throbbing and dripping with semen when he pulled it out of her mouth.
The Sex Mark on her cheek shined bright.
Next, he brought his dick to the dark elf’s ass.
“Ah, wait❤ You didn’t loosen it up first❤❤”
“I don’t need to. Not when you’ve been fingering it yourself this whole time. See, it went in easy.”
“Ohhhhhhhh❤ It’s all sticky with cum❤ This feels so weird❤ And it’s never been this hard right away❤❤”
He had her lift her butt up high while he slapped his hips against her brown butt.
She writhed in pleasure, but then Emilia and Claris started sucking on her nipples. Rosetta kissed her on the lips to share the semen he had given her.
Lielle writhed all the more as the four of them went at her entire body like some kind of torture.
“Ahhhhhn❤ Yes❤ Why do I love this so much?❤”
“I’m about to cum. I’ll fill your dark elf ass with it.”
“Ahhh❤ Yessss❤ All that thick stuff is filling my belly❤❤❤”
When he pulled out, semen flowed out of her trembling asshole. Her Sex Mark glowed bright right next to the contrast of white semen on brown skin.
Without even taking a break, Kyle moved over to Emilia and Claris.
￼
“I see you couldn’t resist, Claris. You’re already soaked after scissoring with Emilia.”
“I can’t help it… Rubbing against her feels so good.”
“Okay, I had planned to do you separately, but both at once works too.”
Kyle let the queen and maid continue embracing and rubbing their clits together while he alternately stuck his penis in one and then the other.
The queen was on top and her vagina squeezed tight.
The maid was on the bottom and her vagina was embraced him softly.
Enjoying both forms of pleasure back to back rapidly brought him toward his next ejaculation.
“Ah, hh, Kyle’s cock❤ And Claris’s pussy❤ Both feel incredible❤ It’s like my entire body is just one big pussy❤”
Emilia’s pleasure stimulated Kyle’s penis through her vagina.
And when he pulled out of her and put it in Claris again…
“Hyah!?❤ My clit is being squeezed from both sides❤ M-my clit is being squashed between Queen Emilia’s pussy and King Kyle’s cock❤”
As her pleasure grew, she also squeezed his dick tight.
His dick was close to exploding after only two or three times inside each of them.
“Kh, I’m about to cum.”
“G-give it to me first❤”
“N-no fair, Queen Emilia❤”
“I’ll give you each half.”
The first shot of semen went inside Emilia.
“Ah, ahhhh❤ Kyle’s semen❤ It’s flowing into my womb to knock me uuuuuup❤❤❤❤❤”
He soon pulled out and thrusted inside Claris.
His penis throbbed to fill the maid with the cum he had left.
“Th-there’s so much of it inside me❤ I-I can’t believe it❤ It keeps throbbing and shooting out more❤ I’m sharing a creampie with Queen Emilia❤❤❤❤❤”
The semen he had ejaculated while moving between them covered their labia. It mixed with their love juices to make their wet pussies even messier.
At the same time, their Sex Marks glowed bright enough to clearly make out their shape.
The Sex Marks indicated a magical link with Kyle.
The brighter the marks shined, the deeper that connection.
His link with them had grown strong enough that the light did not wane even when he was doing four of them at once.
But all four of them appeared to still be experiencing the pleasure of orgasm. They were breathing heavily and looked to him with melted faces.
“Kyle…I want more. I want you to hit my jee spot much, much more❤” said the queen.
“I, um, want more inside me too. I won’t be able to have your child otherwise❤” bashfully said the maid.
“P-put it in my pussy too. Look how wet it is thanks to you❤” said the knight.
“I want to enjoy it in that hole too. I, well, can’t get pregnant from the rear hole❤” said the dark elf.
Kyle smiled bitterly and nodded.
“Understood. Line up on your backs for me.”
They did as he asked.
It was truly a sight to behold.
They all had different appearances, positions, and backgrounds, but they all smiled at Kyle in the nude.
They all spread their legs and spread their pussy lips with their fingers to show him their vaginas.
They wanted his cock inside there immediately.
They didn’t have to say it out loud at this point.
Seeing that got his dick hard again in no time.
 
Kyle wiped off his sweat and climbed out of the bed.
He looked down at the incredible scene.
The four women were lying there in a highly indecent state.
Emilia and Rosetta were lying on their backs with their legs spread wide. Claris and Lielle were on all fours with their butts sticking up high.
They all had a mixture of semen and love juices flowing from their pussies. The rest of them was also soaked with cum and a frothy white saliva-cum mixture dripped from their mouths.
He had no idea how many times he had ejaculated.
Over and over, he had cummed inside them and cummed on them. Whenever it looked like his penis was down for the count, they would take turns orally getting him hard again, but then they would get carried away and make him cum in their mouth. By the end, the had entirely forgotten about doing this to create an heir. All five of them had only been interested in the pleasure.
He sighed and sat back on the bed.
He had never imagined anything like this when he left his rural mansion.
And back when he had been a high schooler in modern Japan, he had never imagined he would end up living the harem life surrounded by elves.
But he had no regrets.
By some twist of fate, he had been reborn in this world and obtained a strange form of recovery magic.
He felt certain his magic would still be useful for Emilia, the other elf women, and the kingdom as a whole.
“This is all thanks to you, Emilia.”
But she did not seem to hear his heartfelt thanks.
Those four had been lying on the bed, seemingly entirely spent, but now they were climbing on top of him again.
“What are you taking a break for, Kyle?❤ I haven’t swallowed anywhere near enough cum❤❤”
“My ass wants more so badly it’s throbbing❤❤”
“Um…I want you to tug on my clit so hard it feels like you’re tearing it off❤❤”
“Kyle, you might not have impregnated me yet, so let’s be extra certain❤❤❤”
“…………As you wish.”
The heat and feminine scents coming from their bodies had him erect again, like his penis was indestructible.
The first night of his harem was not over yet.
 
Emilia and Kyle ruled together as queen and king.

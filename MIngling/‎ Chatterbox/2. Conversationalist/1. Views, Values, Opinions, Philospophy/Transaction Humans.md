Human interactions are value exchange but don't you want to be valued? Tell me.
Suppose if value i  cirrently extracting from you is. " Working in ... And I talking with you I can talk about my feeling and whatnot ireally never had a friend with whom I can talk of my emotions in this manner/(every friendship is unique so it's play word lie don't reveal it to them)"
**So is value exchange such bad thing or what u don't like Is being valued for something that doesn't make you feel valued. I think you want to feel valued for idk soul/heart/...**


**Personality Based Judging noblity attached FALSE PSEUDO.**
I feel nobility attached to personality based judging & not on money/look/etc are as shallow as all. Cause it too is biologically determined & other factors which user have no access over.
Its like saying i dont judge womenâ€™s beauty on how their natural beauty BUT how they look with makeup.
IN END everyone is trying to extract something & some humans just love extrating entertainment/drama for personality more.
I think i will place the highest emphasis on values

## River Styx
In Greek mythology, the River Styx is a river that separates the world of the living from the realm of the dead. It is one of the five rivers of the underworld, along with the Acheron, the Cocytus, the Lethe, and the Phlegethon. 
#WondersOfWorld
The River Styx was believed to encircle the underworld nine times and was often depicted as a dark and foreboding river with murky waters that flowed from the underworld. It was guarded by Charon, the ferryman who transported the souls of the dead across the river in exchange for a fee. In some myths, it was also the site of a binding oath that the gods would take to swear allegiance to one another. The name "Styx" comes from the Greek word "stygós," which means "hateful." Crossing the River Styx represented a point of no return and was a border between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Even the gods could not cross it without permission from Charon. The River Styx was believed to have healing properties, and some myths claimed that it was possible to gain immortality by bathing in its waters. Breaking a promise made on the River Styx was believed to bring severe consequences from the gods.

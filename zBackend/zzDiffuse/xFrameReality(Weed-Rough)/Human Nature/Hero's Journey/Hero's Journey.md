”Change happens when 
**The Old Order** is destroyed, 
experiencer is plunged into the sea of CHAOS 
**A New Order** is established.”

Think of this as old order dies and new order is born, 
Some order are sustainable: Breathing, Home, Family
Some order are unsustainable: Denial
Optimal Movement should be towards SUSTAINABLE ORDER, but you have to stop clinging to UNSUSTAINABLE order.
Only something drastic usually changes SUSTAINABLE ORDER.
(Order1→ Order2 establish, Order 1 dies → Order3 establish, Order2 dies → Order4 establish, Order3 dies)
No order on earth is truly sustainable 
While you live, your years adds up (Repercussion) and you die
In love, your years adds up (Repercussion) and you seperate.
QUEST FOR IMMORTALITY 
QUEST FOR HEAVEN
Is a way to run away from reality.



1. **Ordinary World**
	Death of loved one, Job Change, New Role, Titan destroying, Abandonment, Betrayal, Moving to new place, Falling in love, Discovering something, Meeting someone, Learning A Secret, Accusation Of Crime, Incoming War, Trials and tribulation
	You realize how much unconsiously you were dependent
	Very ground turns hostile
	You maybe thinking you’re doing everything right (Unaware) but they all turn on you
2. **Denial Of Fall Of Order** **& Berating New Order**
	Kaneki not eating meat, Clinging to hallucinations, Clinging to false hope, Lying to self, I can’t do this, It’s impossible for me, I am too weak.
	*Repercussions for Not Adapting*
	(wheter experiencer notice or not notice) which will add up and eventually this order will become unsustainable
	IMPETUS OF CHANGE GROWS which slowly OUTDO power of DENIAL
	GUN TO THE HEAD, DIE OR TRANSFORM.
	Have to realize you’re RESPONSIBLITY FOR action. 
	YOU ARE in vicious DEPENDENT/CODEPENDENT relationship.
	*Berating New Order*
	 Suyash indulging in own arrogance that he dont need to know, his intution will tell him.
	 I am a king, i wont eat this foul stuff.
	 ==IT’S PITIFUL IF PERSON IS STUCK IN DENIAL since they loose GROWTH OPPORTUNITY==
	 ==IT’S PITIFUL if SOMEONE ELSE  takes toll for SOMEONE’S ORDER FALL==
	 *Irresponsibility, Escaping & Victim*
	 The irresponsible continued action & piling repercussions, have to be sometimes bear by those around the expiencer to maintain and preserve the experiencer who is living in UNSUSTAINABLE ORDER, it’s the people who they surround themselves with becomes the sacrifice to sustain, the unsustainable order.
	 Example- DAD! he didnt adapt or change, his ignorance and arrogance create havoc and recurcussion were felt by mom has to bear so much pain, his self-indulging which resulted in being kicked around in his job.
	 [[3_2023 March#DAY 17 |Example Of CHILDISH PERSON being irresponsible]] - Correct response would have been acknowledgment of wrong order, accepting that order isnt right and needs change, not denial of it.
	 M
1. **New Tools Or Mentor Or Exploration**  
	You have SEEN something you can no longer UNSEE, you can’t deny anymore. The old world has burned to ashes.
	You are now in RADAR OF ENEMY/CHAOS
4.  **Getting Mauled** **(Hell)**
	You will be mauled by chaos who will strip you naked or badly
	Other people trying to tear you down (Fear, monster, etc)
	They see something that you’re doing but they are too afraid to do, they wish they could do, someone would help.
	You yourself are guilty of doing this to others. Example-Sumo
	Criticism & Negativity
5. **Confronting Problem & Invinciblity**
	Either mentor helps them or something else that help them to defend themselves from getting mauled or they go beyond it where they are untouchable by old.
	Practice this martial art not that
	*The way person approach enemy changes, it stop being so intimidating and now looks childish, meaningless or stupid*
	Do this thing/way and not that thing/way,
	EXPERIENCER has to change their BUILDER FUNCTION (Ni, Ne, Si, Se) to be at CONTINUOUSLY/COMPOUND GROWTH PATH.
	UNLIKE OTHERS WHO WHEN SUBJECTED TO SAME HELL, GAVE UP
	==Experiencer can’t give up, he cant afford to even he wants to, his self no longer matter, he is looking at things larger than him:- family(Brother, sister, parents, wife ,kids), community, tribe, cause==
	He has to ***plunge into chaos***, he can’t wait to see it all then act, HE **FIGHTS MONSTER**, Defeats them, then after rdefeating them his eyes becomes open and he *sees*
1. **Getting Anchored to the New World**  
	He experiences greater clarity, freedom and love for the new world
	Experiencer meets love_interest which stars making him like new order even more
	He will have **temptations (pleasure, fear, power) from ‘waves of old world’ & new world** and if MC gives into them, **he will spiral down**

# From Kid To Man
Child experiences a problem mom and dad cannot solve cause they have never experienced
PROBLEM bigger than parent’s have ever conquered
Kid can’t become adult in father’s shadow
Prophet doesnt get respected in his own hometown, they willn’t see who is he now & how has he changed but remeber him by old impression, how he was when he was teenager and reminisce him by those stories

# Impulsive to calculative
Bruce wayne when he sees the killer of his parents, instead of lounging at him & attacking him, he didnt give into impulse but calculate

# Delusions to reality
Moving from delusions to reality, leads to death of the experiencer, he attains enlightenment & realises the evil he harbor dinsie
Chaos=Which look to big 
Parents=Appeared so almighty as child, they can do anything
Now it all becomes playground.
From Chaos to Consious  - He no longer sees world as fair or unfair, his fear vanishes, all veil of mysteries comes off
Person goes from **TAKER→ GIVER** & becomes **MORE RESPONSIBLE**

# Fixed Mindset VS Growth Mindset
*Following old order is gratifying, cozy, comforting that’s why we resist change.*(Fixed Mindset)
*Growth Mindset=Confronting Chaos Intentinally* (Growth Mindset)
Instant Gratification —> Focused Building
Selfish—> Servant
Closed Minded —> Zen






Thor transforms from in beginning being an whining tantruming chid to resposible, dutiful adn ready to sacrifice for tribe.
Expanding of consiousness and perception, begin to see more things that old self was ignorant of.

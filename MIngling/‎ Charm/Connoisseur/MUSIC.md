(Spend more time making list)
Well, which songs are my favorite depends on my mood & mental state.
If i am feeling bit dull (after working hard  & pushing myself in study) - 
i listen Eromanga Sensei ED & Farming in another world Opening
Soulful (Melenchanoy but in beautiful sense) - Aiki, memories, genhoshino-comedy
Soulful (Lonely) 
Cherry/Playful mood - songs are too boring, they just lack lusture
Romantic - Dandelions, Sad Song & Can i have this dance
Death/Separation Melancony - Let you go, if i die young
Love-Separation - A thousand year
Self-Love- I see your monster

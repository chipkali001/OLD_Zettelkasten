# VIPIN
In 8th class, there was a new kid vipin. 

Even after few week or months. I don't remember exactly passed. He didn't seemed to have many close friends. It felt more like his bond were little shallow from what i observed. I felt sad for him but i didn't do anything.

It was that time when i was having the bestest time of life. It was the first phase in my life, i felt so happy and excited. Everyday i will look forward to all fun things that will unfold next day.

I was in a clique of very  fun people for first time too. From childhood till now. I have only had few 1 close friend with whom i will spend maximum time in school. I although i had groups in which i was partof but i felt kinda distant that i don't fit here. But there I was feeling like its own place. It felt so nice. 

Die to knowing each other for long time so i had gret synergy with everyone. 

There were many time we all together coaxed and emotionally blackmailed teacher to give us game-period. 

And then we will play 'baaraf paani' 'sun moon land water' 'just sitting in field and talking'

Well to sum it all up.

I was having time of my life.

And I felt our group was coolest of all the other groups/cliques in class.

Our group was center of attention.

So it made me feel great.

..

Now when i looked at vipin who didnt have many friends.

I felt like there nothing i can do about it. 

i can't just leave my group and go sit next to him.

There is not enough space in my life for  more friends.

It was not a thought but a feeling and it prevented me from taking action.

…

Well.. days passed but then a opportunity presented itself.

It was a period where teacher was super late in coming to class.

I don't remember exact details but i went to him and talked to him.

I talked to him in relaxed, laid-back and friendly manner and i was able to befriend him easily.

(And the reason why i didn't felt any hesitation approaching and talking to starnger classmate was cause our group was center of attention. So i knew that he already knows me and so i was actually not much of strange perosn for him and he probably has high image of me so it's easy.)

 vipinnwas kind, nice, polite, pure boy (even his attempts on saying an abuse was not from heart and felt like he was trying too hard to abuse was more like he was.trying.to.copy so even his gaali felt cute and childish) ,  i helped him in making more friends by pulling him along to place where i sit and there it was not like i said to my friends to become friends to him directly. But because i frequently bring him there + i will make talks about him. He got the opportunity to become friends with them easily

 Slowly devrath, arpan , Kunal too become friends with him and will tease him too so i guess to were good enough close. Vipin also had an imaginary foreigner girlfriend. 

As day went by, i noticed that he was feelin really happy and was blending in well and it made me really really happy. 

But there were lot of times when i was unconsiouly tearing him as background character and when i will notice it i will feel  guilty and worry if i am making vipin lonely by giving him little relevalce sometime but i felt like he was too unperceptive to pickup these small cues. So he is in ignorance bliss. But i will tell myself on many instance that i will not unconsiouly give him less relevance. But he had many friends very fastly (all from my own circle and he got to flirt with girls a little) so overall he must be happy. 

(I remember one incident where while feeling truth dare or some game of that sort. Somya said to him that 'he looks like girl or have voice like fo girl so he will most likely not have a girlfriend ' ijoked. Because of that i felt sorry for him and didnt think the joke was funny. But she was girl i had crush on so i didnt get angry. Now thinking back i should have gotten angry or maybe made fun of her with vipin behind the back to make him feel good but i was too in my head.

And vipin didn't showed sadness in front of group which he obviously wouldn't . Somya was queen bee type of girl aand he too had crush on her so so her words must have extra weightage for him.

I am angry at myself for not being angry and have spine to stand for my friend

If I give you the ability to see one internal information about each person you see, what will it be?

You can choose any one internal information.

Check how much person is honest (In percentage)

Or maybe percentage happy 

Or it can be very specific like

Do you like “Your favourite book”

BUT IT HAS TO BE ONE THING

Chaalaki mt krna by saying something like

‘Present thought’ wrong ‘Thought on this __’

‘Present emotional state’ wrong ‘how much angry?’

‘Deepest Desire’ wrong ‘Deepest Desire related to __’‘

Question

There's a starving human in front of me and a starving insect let's say starving ant.

If i give food to human he will live maybe for 1-2 days before dying. But if i give food to ant. Their whole colony can feed off that piece of bread. And who knows how mong they can live just one bread.

Explanation & Nuances -

So who should i give food to.

According to normal moral values, you should help human. Why cuz he belongs to same species as us. Ants are so small and we see them as something seperate and far from us so our compassion dont extend to them.

With human you can tell yourself you are good human being.

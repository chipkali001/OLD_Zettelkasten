The body only begins to breathe once it's part of Mother Earth. Life before that is like trying to feed your soul with ashes.

And the only existence
is the one that you love.

I was little

he looks like those people that look very serious but when you get to know them they're actually very chill and make jokes



I think I remember feeling a bit spiritual when I contemplated after a delay what it meant to have reached a point where I own my own house, because of what that meant for the future and how I felt I'd made it. 

Or when I've made connections between two ideas before, like figuring out that electronic analogies apply just as evenly to financial ones and mechanical ones

Intelligence - books-smart, streets-smart, emotional intelligence 

Question to ask
When did ou think you and to use lot of your intelligence? What was task/goal.


**perception isn't intelligence**
Emotional intelligence
Should be emotional awarness.
emotional intelligence would be more of when you are constantly making adjusting, with how you say, what you say, priming others and tweaking their concepts of you and world to put yourself in maximum leverage position.
**POLITICS & therapy**

**Most of streetsmart encomass too is awareness & skill**

**like some human being may consider themselves more intelligent over Computers which is dumb. I belive when you have to same amount of input**




# Pity vs Respect
Book english 
1. Lost Spring
	- Story1 (School make (Lightly treat as joke), Shoes Get, Job get freedom, )
	- Story2 (Airplane why not WHEN he is already not bangle and workings damn hard going far place to learn, noone same)
2. On The Face Of It (what he was trying to tell and sad about - he doesn’t want to people talk out of pitied)
3. A Roadside Stand (he also says)
Foreigner Experience IN SLUMS Recording Camerea - Attack cuz they have come to record them and show poor - THEY CALLED IT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE

# Slavery vs Freedom
==1)==
Suppose in hyper ahead future.
You ahve technology AI SUPER GODLY
where you can put it on your ahead and you are into fantasy world. 
You can be anything there bird/tiger/male/female/child/long/short anything and everything, you can do infinite things.
And all thing is control and hyper optoimzed by AI.
AI will never let you get bored - making you live stories , experiences.
**Now i hear people talking of this as AI SLAVES EVERYONE,**
If you agree to submmerge yourself. Will you consider as choosing to become *SLAVE* or it frees you?



==2)==
In a way both are tied together
HOW and WHERE you draw line.
I think it’s by **BASELINE** of the possibility get to explore 

Like - lion in zoo & lion in a forest
What if we give him


3)
Animal would have died out of starvation 
So natural for animal death at birth and other in wild, cruel deaths, diseas torment
But there they get privilege
Now to animals in Zoo/sanctury stuff.
It is seen as SLAVING animal.


# ==i heard about people willn’t plug themselves in machine that gave infinite pleasure==
# **BeerBiceps Dr. Nilmila Chitgopekar**
Wanted to try lean lil religious lore MAYBE become spirtual SELF - loathed
HATED that’s nice
1. Beauty Queen, Rich - we mop at lost BEAUTY POTENTIAL (like child death but not for an old dead IN SAME WAY)
2. **Make self FEEL superior** 
*REPEATS AGAIN unlike ORTHODOX NOT WRONG but is blinding & CALL SELF BEYOND* 
3. Glorify sacrifice and allow it by saying
	- Oh tradition different! 
		- CURELITY IS CRUELITY nothing justify
	- Transcend (not affected by gore, shame)- how can see decapitated head
		- DUMB, you can condition self to not feel disguist
	- Sacrificed cuz goddess killed
4. Dumb Person Talk- Says people don’t wanna talk cuz represnt shiva in bad light- (
	- Shiva wish to know what he represents
	- ANY person could have written it
	- I feel shiva represent something higher than this foolish. DON’T BRING HIM DOWN TO THIS LEVEL why such stuff relevant - that’s LOWER LEVEL HUMANS for me clearly - meme content
		- Shiva and __ fight like normal couples do. DUMB i felt he represented something higher 
		- says to kali you’re kali but you’re called mahacall calliing me kali)




# 2. Indian nationalist are unbeatable in fake history making competiton
## It’s the dumbest most numbing crap I see
1. Distance sun from earth - they show it as multiplication of 3 stuff in and three can be anything their quantity not fixed. like hands length
2. Spaceship & atom bombs - can talk and talk - they conflate
## Using these for Gratification
Actual Hindus laugh at these people they’re uneducated and use social gratification to justify their existence within the sphere of the philosophy
- They are charlatans, they deserve no praise because to them god is a commodity for gratification

Like at places everyone shouts, one friend who consider himself very religous & patriotic saying - 
“Like this bhakti bhi ho jati hain” (when crowd shouting)
**gods are symbollic**
NOW THIS IS DISRESPECTFUL - You ar devaluing what person actually represented & stod for & what evils he do (you must heard of putting molten metal in ear of child who overheard Brahamans talkling in sanskrit and he died)


## 2. Be proud in yourself not insecure via lies
> [!Error] Indian culture has given so much to the world that if we just didn’t lie and actually focused on being educated it would be better for people

@Shibo Ares 
Greate indian schools of spirituality are GOAT and legendary
But think of all the cringe things they say ,like everything existed in India in 10,000 BC , mahabharatha describe  atom bomb etc
Damn damn
I agree with you, Indian history is very influential and has a lot of merits but like…conspiracy theories are just that, and dumb

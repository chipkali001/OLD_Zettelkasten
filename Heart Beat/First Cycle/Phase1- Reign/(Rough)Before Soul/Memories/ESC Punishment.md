# ESC Punishment
In class 6-7th my, EQ or brain grew a little. I developed two strategies to escape punishment of the teacher.

Show respect towards, touch feet, say good morning.

Acts innocent,guilty and gloomy when caught

Though many times, there wasn't an opportunity to do respect point but gloomy point helped me a lot.

There were few instances where teacher kicked my friends out of class and exempted me from punishment. My friends would get angry and say to mam, i was involved too but I will act innocent and as i don't know what they are talking about. I will act like i am about to cry and I have been very sensitive since childhood so when put into a tough situation where everything feels overwhelming, crying comes really very naturally to me, there are two types of crying, first is tears crying and second one is when your voice starts cracking and you are one verge of crying, so it was second one mostly.

My friends held grudge against me after that.

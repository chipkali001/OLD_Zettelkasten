5th class, Standford festival i dont remember name but maybe it was adventure’s day. My friend didnt came so i felt really sad & lonely. I was new in school, everyone had their little gangs. I badly wanted to go home. I was trying really hard to not lose heart and pretend to happy. As if i dotn care if someone is here or not. However these -ve emotions got thrown away when i first sat on that Spherical ball which was being rolled. Suddenly the day became memorable and i really enjoyed it. I was looking forward for the same festival next year

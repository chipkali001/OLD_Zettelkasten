ENFJ one of most CLOSE-MINDED.
ENJs generally like alcohol with groups
DIC
Socially oriented, crafting best social experience.
if they feel someone is down, they’ll try to bring them up but if they cant bring them up, then they are like screw you - you can be there alone Mr. dark cloud.
Se child - want to give perfect experience to everyone - good at giving everyone good experience (kitchen, bedroom, et)

Fe + Se- how everyone feel so they put other needs before themselves often treated as doormat. if it is done subtly they may not even recognize that if they dont have past data Si-Trickster

ENFPs most manipulative, take advantage of high Fe users

They walk around thinking everyone around them is making a bad decision for future. Very quick to point fingers that you are making bad decisions.

Se(child)+Ti(Inferior)+Ne(critic) - dont trust anyone - even if person has past record of loyalty they say ~well this case could be special.

Live in covert contract land - I am giving you experience so want loyalty, you should be ready to die for me too.

They are all in or all out.

Ti(inferior)- men believe they are always right BUT DEEP DOWN they are afraid they are stupid, rave recognition & external validation.
Dont tell them they are stupid. Atleast listen to them.
ESTJ demon try to control every aspect of live
ONE TYPE you should overcommunicate with. even if they act like Trivia doesnt matter. they want to listen to each trivial information & their Ti inferior feel good if they have information

Once they get over their Ti(inferior) - their ISTP comes out and they becopme one of the most diligent people.

**ISXP are most diligent people**

Si trickster super forgetful - one thing enter ear other thing exit out

Fi(nemesis) - everyday worried about self worth - they want recognition from others- external validation - appreciation 
THEY ARE PERFECTIONIST.
They dont get arrogant from appreciation - Se(chid) will for a moment - but they will again become humble as tehy go back into area of fear.
THEIR  LOVE LANGUAGE 
1st - “Words of Affirmation”
2nd - GIFTS

INFP love language 1st-gifts 2nd-words of affirmation

they jump to conclusion - criticize others for intentions - mistrusting with others. 

Fe(Hero)- can be guilted easily.

XNFPs are master at using guilt to get what they want.

They are very benovelent & Caring
but they an turn into cruel taskmaster with a whip

**PLAYING NARRCISITS by missaying what htey say- like andrew tate used**

OBSERVE. EVERYONE VERY VERY INTRICATELY SO YOU CAN STEAL FROM THEM EVEN STEALING FEW PHRASE OUT OF AN DIALOGUE IS GOOD ENOUGH cuz YOU’LL ONLY BECOME MORE GODLY WITH ALL OF THAT

Sometimes you will have to make an decision. Choose an side an act. That was the problem that happened on first day of JPM. 

YOU HID TOTALLY. You remained INDECISIVE. Instead of ACTING.

YOU CAN’T ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO CONTROL. THE RIGHT BUTTONS TO PUSH.

It’s okay sometimes you’ll be defeated. YOU’LL NOT KNOW A COMEBACK.
 BUT YOU CAN USE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, to find a NEW TACTIC THAT YOU DIDN’T KNEW EXISTED IN MY PLAYBOOK.

i'll give the game away i'll give the game away to the entire youtube world why i've destroyed absolutely everybody in any debate ever i say

things that they know are true and that they agree with but i say in a way that angers them emotionally and they get caught up in their brain because they're

saying he's saying the truth but i'm pissed off by how he's saying it so i want to argue with him but he's right

so instead of saying men are physically stronger than women i'll say females are weak

females are weak well females are weak females are weak men are strong females are weak no females but i'm right and he knows

i'm right but he's mad now and so is she and they sit there and you'll happen happen on dave portnoy you end up having

a whole group of people sitting there trying to argue well some women are strong white men trying to argue the

fact that women are the strongest men physically because i've emotionally controlled them all and upset them all

and then i do a podcast they get billions and millions of views and unlimited likes against good debaters like dave and his little crew by just

emotionally controlling them it's an emotional game i reckon i've never given this game away before anywhere but this

is what i do i sit there and i say something they know is true in a way they can't agree with it and i [ __ ] control them all

because they're stupid if i was me i'd be like yeah okay perhaps i don't like the way you phrased it but you're very you're very true that takes intellect

people are emotional so this is why i wreck all of them and you're right i poke them on purpose and it makes it very difficult to argue with me

especially if they agree with what i'm saying but they don't like the way it's being said that's where you see the full breakdown it's the full mental breakdown

MEN WITH HAMMER

they knew it was gonna be messy right and i always had one hand behind my back as well i had nothing in it

just like nothing in it who knows what's back there you have to do something right

so they're looking at me and they're like [ __ ] sake we thought he'd say sorry and he didn't now what do we do

Buy this it will look Good on you [salesperson] 

Oh! Are you gonna me as gift?will you pay bill for this .

Yes i too have started like this (mischeivois)

Kisi aur mausum ko thoglo.

ANALYZE AND LEARN EFFECT OF TUMHE KYA LAGTA HAI SENTENCE

Stealing a small thing, then getting caught.
You try to justify yourself and act try to resist to create a shopw in front of the tone who caught you to believe that you got caught and youre scared. You try to make it seems natural.
But the small thing you get caught doing was just a diversaion to hide the bigger thing you stole.
Example - Me Cake eating secretly. Cake was in a box cutten intop pieceds and fiut inot box tightly. There was one big piece and 3 small pieces. I took the big once, slash a slice out pof it. The big slice taking will show something is missing cause box was fully pack so wjhat I did is asked permission frfom mom to eatg the two smaller piece. Now since I ate two piece obviously box will have less space but what they won’t know is that I have eaten a slice from bigger piece earlier.

It took me some time to exactly put in words.
Message1 - One crucial component for my value of love is I want to have someone who i can share things & parts that i dont show/talk to anyone else.
So if you already have bff that you feels like is your best-friend then it doesnt make sense for you to be with me.
It’s really parasitic & cheap if you fulfil some of your desires& needs through me & some through other.
Does your mother have a bff she talks with?
I may forgive and pass this time as you just being ignorant & influened by this trend of having male-bff.
I’ll loose value for you if you, i dont want such a cheap women.

And just another note that i’ve tried my best to not hurt you and talk in language in that will make you feel shame because i you didnt had any wrong intentions.

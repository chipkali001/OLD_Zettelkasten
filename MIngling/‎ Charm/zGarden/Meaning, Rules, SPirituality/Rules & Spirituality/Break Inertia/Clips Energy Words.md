" But....

Â  it's not my fault...

Â  No...

Â  It is.

Â  I am the one to blame. "

- -

" It took a lot of blood for you to learn that lesson.

Â  Do me a favour ? Ok...

Â  Don't just sit there wallowing in your own guilt.

Â  That's not going to change anything , either.

Â  You got a problem with that, you know...

Â  You're complacent.

Â  You never change or adapt.

Â  That's why you're at fault.

Â  Did you think you can blame it on something else.

Â  Coincidence.... Tragedy.... Fate....

Â  Sorry but destiny doesn't exist in this world.

Â  It's all just one person's circumstances colliding with another's.

Â  And who creates those circumstances ?

Â  Would you care to guess ?

Â  It's you , kaneki.

Â  All the detriment in this world, stems from a lack of individual ability.

Â  Jason sure nailed that one.

Â  If you were smart to the ways of the world, you and I may never have come together like this.

Â  All because.... you are such a fool.

Â  But you are supposed to take a moral highroad and suffer right ?

Â  Do you think the lovebirds would agree ?

Â  You could've picked one of them, and the other would still be alive.

Â  But you failed them both.

Â  Why are you crying ?

Â  This is you're doing.

Â  You said you'd rather feel pain yourself than inflict it ok others.

Â  You choose to be neutral.

Â  But you know what happens, when you play both sides ?

Â  In the end, everybody loses.Â 

Â  You saw what happened with your mother. "

- -Â 

" Shut up...

Â  Mom...Mom...

Â  I wish...I wish that you are still here with me.

Â  I hate being all alone.

Â  I miss you so much it hurts.Â 

Â  Why ? Why couldn't you just lived for me ?

Â  You had a choice.

Â  Why didn't you choose me ?

- -

Â  Even if it meant forsaking your aunt ?

- -

Â  Yes , if she'd be here now.

- -

Â  Even if it meant hurting her ?

- -

Â  If it had to be done.

- -

Â  Even if it meant killing her ?

- -

Â  Whatever it takes. "

- -

" Good boy...

Â  Now you got it kaneki.

Â  You learned the lesson your mother couldn't seemed to grasp, that sometimes, to protect one thing, you have to have the resolve to let go of another.

Â  Her actions didn't make her kind, they made her weak.Â 

Â  She didn't have the resolve...

Â  The strength to turn her back and focus on what's important.

Â  But you're not weak like she was...

Â  You have the power to break this chain of grief. "

- -

" I won't let that happen.

Â  Anyone wo tries to take them from me...

Â  Will get no mercy. "

- -

" I what if your decision ends up being the wrong one in the end. "

- -

" That won't happen.

Â  Because I am not wrong...

Â  What wrong is this messed up world. "

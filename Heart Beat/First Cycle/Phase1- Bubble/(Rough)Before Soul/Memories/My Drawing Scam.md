I remember, we had a sir nikhil sir and kids said that he looked like Virat Kohli. I don't watch cricket so maybe he did but i wasnt excited or unxexcited.

I liked to draw. So one day there was video on how to draw Virat Kohli (actually i wanted to draw female potrait but didn't as i felt its something vulgar. What will my parent say)

It was timefasten video where perosn draw sketch of Virat Kohli. I copied it to best of my abilities.

Next day i showed it.to.sir and he was overjoyed. He even take picture of it and made it his wallpaper.Â 

He praise me in front of whole class and showed them.

I was feeling proud but at the same i felt there was misunderstanding. I didn't really had to put that much effort into anything.. i just tried to imitate what the person in yt video did and everyone seems to think that it was something done out of imagination or internet search reference.

This reminds of a different thing

I also remeber that arpit didi, used to praise my drawings. I just used to trece over the drawing of Krishna and other gods from my picture book by keeping my page one page below the page i wish to copy them run pencil real hard on outlines so it leaves mark. Then trace those marks again

We are done!

She even asked me multiple times to draw drawinge for her. It felt really amazing.

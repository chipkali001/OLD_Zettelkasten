**Direct VS Indirect**
Home is out of milk so
Direct - We are out of milk, go get it or i will get it. 
Indirect1/Informative1 - Oh we are out of milk (Leave other person to be directive & decide)
Indirect2/Informative2 - Oh we are out of milk, kidA is about to come from school,…. ( may Gives unnecessary information)
In extreme direct person come of as bossy.
In extreme indirect person will come of as having victim mindset Or Manipulative  (I bought milk yesterday day, you are always like this i have to go in heat to go get…)
Informative person may come of as beating around the bush.


**Systematic** - One way to say and do things.
**Interst based**- My answer depends on PEROSN WHO IS ASKING QUESTION their level, depth, personality, etc.
The person who finishes his dinner first is probably interest based.
Systematic may loose sight why they do certain things teh way the ydo.
Interest based may SEE everything as transaction ESPECIALLY Ne-Nemisis (Ni heros - INFJ INTJ)

Ni-Se  - Statements - Lot of I, **THEY**, REFER TO **OTHERS** & **THEMSELVES** in **2nd person**
Ne-Si - 1st Person
INTEREST BASED HAS BETTER GRASP OVER LANGUAGE


(YOu have to figure out what they do in ego, humans are both, but whats primary secoond nature
FOR Direct-Informative
Initiating-Responding
Control-Movement
Abstract-Concrete
Affiliative-Pragmatic
Systematic-Interest)


Systematic - BOXES, PROCEDURES, said way of doing things. For NTs (Scientific procedure/data, etc)
Interest - MOTIVATION & Point, Game & Transactional, here's what you want here is what i want, NOT ON NORMS but intereset
- JOB INTERVIEW NFs & SPs may come in casual? Who cares?
- I was coming back in class, my head was in Ni & devalue Sensory, i saw Sir was standing outside, talking to a teacher, i dint care, came at my own pace & sit, i was thinking about thing in my head. For them my behavior was reckless & for me them was illogical? There is nothing in it for me mujhe ched kr, aur mee bhi unh e nhi ched rha hun?
- TRANSCATION SEE, going to play, aunty gardening in other direction, no reason to say namaste? she is in her world & i am in mine. (TRANSCATION)
- ESTJ mam in JPM reception
- Or THAT KID JPM (Sports boy) asking me to take permission from sir & then go, SYSTEMATIC
- Interest based may loose details & hyperfocus on motivation
- Systematic may focus too much on details & miss point.  Thats why SPs like Speak man, Speak
- Saitama saying summarise in 10 words interest. Just say it fast so i can get it for you
- SJs nurces proceductre,  ESTJ fitccness proccuders
- Compare ENTP vs ENFP -  this person is constantly talking about system, methodologies,:- process by which change oil in car, new program working with certain people, telling about 4-pillar-of-self-intimacy (WHICH IS SYSTEM)(it can be concealed like this, and u have to unravel it)


ISTJ with ESTP subconsious may THINK i will do it myself not rely on others (Te), that doesnt make them not affiliative cause they are! everything intnertwined.
INTP pragmatic but subconsious ESFJ (affiliative,caregiver) may explain their DOORMAT behaviour

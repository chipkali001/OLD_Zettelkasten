After a long time, Ye Xiaolong came back to his senses, knelt on the ground with a bang, and kowtowed to Xie Huaqiang in horror.

“Brother Qiang, yes… I’m sorry, I’m blind! I didn’t know it was you who came, or I wouldn’t dare to talk to you like that even if I borrowed a hundred courage from me!”




A fortunr teller once told me “öne day…”
But Zhang Feng never thought that this day would come so soon.

**Seeing the scene in front of him**, Zhang Feng couldn’t believe his eyes. ran frantically.
Last night, Chen Wenwen **told** Zhang Feng that she **was going** to the movies with her girlfriends, **so** she **wouldn’t** come **back** at night.

Hearing Zhang Feng’s voice suddenly, Chen Wenwen’s body jolted as **expression changed( panic spread across her face)**, and she subconsciously wanted to **break free**, *but* was hugged(pulled-in) tightly by the boy beside her.
“What are you afraid of?”
“Do you still want to get back together with this poor ghost?”

Chen Wenwen’s **eyes flickered** for a *moment*, the **previous** *panic* was **gone**, and *all that was* **left** was **endless indifference**.

“Zhang Feng, since you found out, **I’ll tell you straight**, your girlfriend is with me!”

“Zhang Feng, I’ve wanted to tell you a long time ago, you are

Then, she turned to look at Brandon with a **fond smile**, draping her hands **through** his arm. “Let's go, Brandon.”

“Excuse me, is this Master Zhang Feng?” **A middle-aged man’s voice ==sounded== from the *other end* of the phone.**

“Well, the one billion just now is only a small part of the inheritance. Most of the remaining fixed assets and other overseas funds need to go through formalities before they can be transferred to you.”

“Master Zhang, I will **discuss** ==***this*** matter== with you **when** you **come over**. If you ~~are free~~ **have time** in the afternoon, you **can come** **to** the 38th floor of the Dihao Building **to find me,** and I *will explain* to you **in person what is going on!**” The middle-aged man said slowly.

>Acting llike end has already decided(discuss when come over.). Formality (if you’re free). When (time)(in the afternoone), Where (38th floor. Dihao Building). For What (to find me). What will follow what (Explain in person)

Zhang Feng hesitated for a while holding the phone, and then said softly: “Okay, then I’ll go find you in the afternoon!”

>said slowly/softly/harshy/raging-tone




“Withdraw money? Don’t you see the ATM next to it?”
“There are ATMs for withdrawing money, so what are you doing at the counter?”

Counterstaff - women heavy makeup, proffessional skirt
“What business do you want to do?”
 “I want to withdraw money.”
 “Withdraw money? Don’t you see the ATM next to it?”
 woman said with some displeasure: “I don’t know how to get it, so just Google it yourself, I’m very busy now!(play’s game on phone)”
 “Where is your lobby manager? Call him out!”
 Is this how your bank operates? I don’t know what it means to say that the customer is God? It’s really unreasonable!”
“What happened?”
 “Manager Wang, this guy is here to make trouble!”
 “I’m here to withdraw the money!”
 (frown & cold voice)“There are ATMs for withdrawing money, so what are you doing at the counter?”
 “What if I… want to take five million?”
 (sized up & sarcastically) “Just you? A food delivery guy, and take five million?“
 (didn’t believe had, is manager. corner mouth twitched as said)"Do you really want to withdraw five million?”
 *the eccentricities of rich people are often beyond what they can imagine*
 “Of course, if I don’t withdraw money, why don’t I come to the bank to play games?”
 “Why don’t you go to the VIP lounge/room for a while?”
 “No problem!”
 “Manager Wang, **you don’t really think he has so much** money, do you?”
After all, Manager Wang is a person who has seen world, KNOWS & not joking, rEALLY

PERSON WONT BE ORDINARY IF HAS CAPABILITY TO WITHDRAW

If it weren’t for him to be a bit more observant, he wouldn’t have offended Zhang Feng with this idiot.

“What? You think it’s too expensive, and you want to go back on your word?” Yang Wei turned to Zhang Feng and asked.

even if Zhang Feng was able to pay the money, he probably spent all his savings.

Is it worth spending all your savings for a so-called face?

When everyone saw the bright red banknotes in Zhang Feng’s delivery box, they immediately **gasped**.

“Okay…Okay!” The beauty in the cheongsam **took the** *stack* of banknotes **tremblingly**.
She didn’t seem to have thought that
“I’ll only give you 70,000 yuan for meals, and he will pay for the rest!”

At this time, the students in the box **stared round their eyes and** *looked at Zhang Feng in shock.*

Because they never expected that Zhang Feng would be able to spend so much money, a total of 70,000 yuan, **without even blinking.**

At this moment, Yang Wei was **sitting in the same position**, and **began to sweat coldly, not knowing what to do!**
Hearing this, Yang Wei **felt his mind went blank.**
“You…you wait for me to make a call…”
Yang Wei stammered back, picked up the phone and started typing.


Yang Wei called almost all his buddies, but no one could lend him money.

The beauty in the cheongsam **saw that Yang Wei** had no money to pay, so she **hurriedly called the security guard** in, standing at the door, she looked at Yang Wei with urging eyes.
“Young Master Yang, quickly think of a way!”
“Don’t worry, I’ll call my dad right now and ask him to transfer the money!”

>==BAD== no money to pay **and** called security guards in **and** stood at door and looked 
>so she ___,  stood, looked    (NOTICE “and” isn’t used )



#
Ten minutes later, Zhang Feng came out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel and wiping his hair.

The bathroom door is next to Mina’s room. When passing by her door, Zhang Feng heard Mina’s voice coming from inside, so he couldn’t help but stop and listen.

The sound in Mina’s room was very loud, and the loud music made Zhang Feng a little uncomfortable, and even Mina’s voice became a **little blurred**/**overshadowed**.

After listening for a long time, Zhang Feng only heard the words “reward”, “brother”, and “follow”.

Zhang Feng’s curiosity was immediately aroused, as if being scratched by a cat’s paw, it was very itchy.
#

Zhang Feng couldn’t help sighing softly.

“Bang bang bang!”
**At this moment**, the door suddenly rang.

>“Bang bang bang!” **At this moment**, the door suddenly rang.
>VS
>“Bang bang bang!” the door suddenly rang.

“Who is it?”

Zhang Feng asked subconsciously.
**But without thinking about it**, He knew who else could be in this room besides Mina.

> ==NOTICE HOW FRAGMENTATION HELPS THIS  SENTENCE== asked without even thinking he knew who it was. Mina.
> -asked subconsiously
> But
> Without even thinking about it,
> He knew *==WHO ELSE==* could be in this room ==besides== Mina

>STRUCTURE ACTION but HYPOCRITE-REALITY
>ACTION(asked subcosiously) then **BUT** (To show contrast/hypocracy), hyperbole obviously. (Even without thinking)
>Say the obvious (Who else could it be ) - REASON-BEHIND-OBVIOUS-IMPLICIT (in this room) →besides Mina




“Zhang Feng, are you asleep?”

Sure enough, Mina’s **soft voice** came from outside the door.

“It’s so late, why did Mina come to me suddenly? 
Could it be that she found out that I’m the Yilan Tingfeng?”
“Have you already had dinner?”
Zhang Feng thought silently in his heart, and then said to the door: “**Not yet**, is there anything wrong?”

>DOUBT(1) in HEART/HEAD & wait FOR AFFIRMATION(2) (TROPE) 
>1.Could it be that she found out that I’m the Yilan Tingfeng? thought silently in his heart
>“Have you already had dinner?”


“Come to my room and I’ll treat you to something to eat.”
“Bring me something to eat? What the hell is she trying to do?”

When Zhang Feng **heard Mina’s ==words**==, the expression on his face suddenly became puzzled.

But after hesitating for a while, he put on his clothes, opened the door and went out.

>MAYBE I HAVE BEEN CAUGHT (TROPE)
>HearingWords →Puzzlement → **Hesitation** → Surreder (put clothes/open-door) → Overthinking

Mina opened the door, and said with a smile: “You are here, come in quickly!”

Entering the room, Zhang Feng realized that he was overthinking, because Mina had already filled the table with delicious food.

>**TROPE** - Action →Response of person → REALITY/Real-Consequence
>Action (Entry) (not telling consequences of action) , Realisation,
>Glancing out of window, Makoto’s body froze realizing what really had happened, the flying rainbow large birds, forest that streches as far as eyes can see. 




# 
He stood there blankly, without refuting a word.

Because in his opinion, these people are just some clowns.
But in the eyes of others, this is Zhang Feng’s cowardly performance.

“Have you laughed enough?”
“No…no, hahaha, let me laugh a little longer.”
“I’ve grown up so much, and I’ve never seen someone like you before. I’m really laughing to death…”

“Zhang Feng, aren’t you going too far? We are all classmates, why are you like this?” Sun Li turned her head and shouted at Zhang Feng.

#
Zhang Feng nodded lightly, then directly handed the phone to Manager Sun, and said lightly, “Someone wants to talk to you!”

“Who is it?”

Manager Sun took the phone from Zhang Feng with a confused face, and asked softly, “Hello, who is it?”

“Sun Qiang, tell me? What are you doing?” Fang Zhihua shouted extremely angrily.
“Fang… President Fang?”
#
“Xu Lu, why are you still standing there? You can go now!”
“Manager Liu, yes… can I get off work?”
“get off work?”
“That’s right, you can leave work now, and it’s a permanent one, so you don’t have to come here anymore!”
**“What are you? Can’t you understand people’s language or something? I said you have been fired, get out of here!”

You don't need to come (more neutral-informative statement) VS You don't have to come (more empathetic, GO BIRD! spread  your wings type vibe)

>==That’s right== instead of ~~Yes~~
>REPEAT (get off work) {astonished at naivety}
>That’s right, 
>you can  , (affirm)
>and it    (indirectly being bold, SARCASM)
>,so    (POLITELY BEING IMPOLITE) -Dont have to come here anymore)
>WHAT ARE YOU (Exclamation at stupidity)
>Can’t you  (Exaggeration to RANT on stubitity)
>DIRECT ON FACE ORDER- I said you have been fired, get out of here! (~~go now~~ —> **Get out of here**)


***At this time***, the three of them were ==full of **curiosity== and puzzlement** about Zhang Feng.

#LifePhase/9thClass #Melancholy  
After ninth grade, I found myself without any real friends. Even the people I had considered friends in school were more like acquaintances. The group of three friends I had in ninth grade were the most mischievous and we were responsible for most of the mischief, but I couldn't stand them. I only hung out with them because they shared my goal of getting into IIT. I don't know where they are now, but I remember hating them. I tried to remove myself from the group, but they saw it as me thinking I was too good for them and they adopted a passive-aggressive attitude towards me. I soon realized that if I cut off the relationship, I would have no group to belong to and would have to spend all my class and lunch periods alone. That would damage the image I wanted to maintain. Eventually, I had to rejoin the group.

Interestingly, in our group, there were three of us: Kartike, Shubhakar, and me. I became really close friends with Shubhakar, who had been childhood friends with Kartike. But this resulted in Kartike becoming distant with Shubhakar, and he adopted a passive-aggressive attitude towards me again. This hurt me a lot because I was very oversensitive at the time and I would absorb his emotions. I couldn't understand why he would do that, but deep down I knew it was because he was jealous. He was jealous of my good grades and I remember one instance where a smart, talented, but reserved girl in our class tried to talk to me and he was very poky with me the whole day after that.

From <[https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat)>

In class9 i used to sit with a kid name shubhakar, he was my friend. Let's call him monkey for now cause you will get contiused between names. Shubhankar was the kid who used to make jokes between classes, joking with tecahers and was overall very charming person. Teachers liked him but at the same time …

There were two other people too kartike and devansh. Let's call them chuza1 and chuza2. Chuza 1 and mine ego rubbed wrongly and because of that were in mind if enemity and he had poky attitude so i was really annoyed by him.

Chuza1 had an kind of asshole type of personality.

r. Chuza2 and vhuza1 weren't that good in study so teacher had little negative image of them.

I consider myself a very vengful person. had this desire for vegance against him but i didn't got much chance to pent it out (i can't fight him phsycisally cause i am too much of a coward i will not fight someone unless i have assurity that i can easily overpower him - and overpowering allow to easily crush someone ego with Brute force.

he and i both had big stature and i knew if we both fight physically noone will really win cause his ego is too big so unless i completely overpower him, i can't defeat him. Direct verbal is difficult too cuz i am not the type of person who will use gaali (its not like i am like speaking gaali is bad, but i just felt it's outside of my character). In the end i can only act in a way, speak and do things that will annoy him and it worked but it was not really fulfilling 

Our SST sir was from somewhere from kerela, Goa, Karnatka (for me the three states were same). He spoke in pure English with accent . And at that time for me understanding english without subtitles was not possible. So i had trouble understanding and following what he is saying and used to feel super super sleepy. It was so difficult for me to just keep myself awake. 

I used to sit in seat where i will have less chances of getting detected by him.

I will always keep my book in slant cover my eyes by using hand as support for head. I will take mini rest like this that in his classes.

It was always my effort that i just become invisible so that sir don't notice me.

But despite all this sir had very high image of me. Now as i said it was not like i was not the type of kid that used to come in top10. Or i was very responsive to whatever sir is talking about.

The image sir had of me was based on a false judgemnet. 

I will tell that story later i thinking i amm going off the rail.

I used to sit with shubhankar who was  charming personality so all the teachers like him. Sir and he will joke around in class, sir will say something to shubhankar, he will follow up and they both eill laugh, class laughs when sir will say something to me, my response was fixed i will smile and nod my head or i will just say yes sir.  I didnt understand even a single joke in the whole year.

(The story is i watched a video on internet on difference between genius and talented person and a part in them was that genius people use imagery not words to create their notes. 

So after that since then i used to rewrite the point in sst notes in doodle form. I will draw cartoon . In sst class i can just pass my time, retracing whatever i drawz rewhading, creating moustache in remade notes and in class sir happened to catch me drawing. 

Sir looked and that and asked me what is this and i expwlined to sir, whatever the thing i learned from video that images are easier to remeber, and by creating story the chapter feels more alive (my wording wasn't like this but whatever words i fumbeled out amounted to something like that. Sir got really impressed and really began to look at me as i am some kind of genius and sir showed it off to the whole class.

I felt really guilty and at the same my ego got a kick out of that. 

But after that sir began to gave me special attention in classes and now it was not possible for me to just hide away and act like some background character. I still had trouble  understanding what sir is saying so whenver sir will look at me. I will just nod and say yes. 

Also sir had high expectation for me to perform in sst exam and now i will have to uphold to it or my fake image in sirs mind will crumble.

Example - "which was your previous school?"

Uum it was school in sonipat Haryanam. It was at place neat up and haryana border.

"What was it's name?"

You won't remeber the name why are you even asking question. And there is only certain amount of question you can ask a strange before conversation becomes akward .

My first few weeks and months in new school was disappointing.

I didn't made friends for a long time.

I couldn't connect.

Also the culture were different, people in haryana Stanford school were wild. They didn't cared about studies at all and in boys it was only 1 variable student beside me who was bit serious about students. They all were free souls. None of them cred about rules or getting caught and punished and i just admired them a lot. I was too much of a pussy and i just found them cool. I don't want complain to go to my house cause it will taint image of my sincere child.

But after class8 was over i have decided that  i am going to enjoy these two years i have to fullest cause after that i will go to Kota and willnt have chance of going to school. So i am going to make lot of memories here. I will not care if teacher complain or whatever. 

However the new school was rigid and strict and the kids were the same. They were all civilised or normal.

I found them kind of boring, but i didn't have word boring in my mind, so i just felt that i don't belong here.

I had lot of friends back at home that i really enjoy company of and talking to

Friends in my gully and friends in school with whom i have been for long time so the shift from having a lot of friends to sudden having everything just stripped away was painful and i felt remorsful that my precious 9th and 10th class. I will not get to have good memories.

I really had a very strong faith in God and a strong sense of destiny (everything happens for a reason).

So i just thought this is so that god can show me the value of the Friendships.

Cause deprevation is the only way you understand real value of stuff.

 and maybe i have enjoyed my 8th class bit too much ( the last 8-9 months, were the happiest i ever felt in my life. I was so excited and happy to school ebryday, world was so so rosy. I had lot of experience like getting to eating with my crush, playing different games together, emotionally balckmailing teachers to get games period, we had lot of weeks where we were going to ground 2-3 times a day and it was just amazing.) .

I have used too much of my positive karma so i am in some sort or debt so god is trying to even out stuff by giving me equal sadness and misery for the happiness he bestowed upon me in the last year.

So that allowed me to bear the pain of isolation, broken hope of enjoying my 9th and 10th, lying to my parent when they ask about my friends in new school. Evrything was bearable though sometimes me bhagwan ko Kosta tha ki why cant i have just a normal life, i don't have done anything to recieve your judgement. And actually my cries were answered for.short time.

I remember it was art period (some kids go to singing, some to music, some for art)

So for art we have to go to different section and in that all sections students were combined in one class and class used to be super messy. Everything is spread on desks, etc

 and it was basically a free period.

I will find a desk where i can sit alone in middle position cause mam used to pay super attention to kids who sat on back so sitting in middle seat but not in middle row helped me blend in crowd.

 i will just sit and solve maths, physics 11th module questions secretly and on top i will pretend to draw when mam comes near me and since class was messy i can keep the book on left side and mam willnt suspect anything she will think it's book of some other kid.

So when i was solving questions like normal days.

My first two friends talked to me, actually the two of them were interested in iit preparation too so we were able to become friends quickly and apparently remember when i said that i found people in class boring but the two of them were the most funny and troublemaking and harami type. 

I mean whats the coincidence of this happening so i though maybe god has blessed me.

Initially kartike and i were good friends cuz 

He wanted to go to iit after 12. 

After us metting and becoming friends. I encouraged him doing class11-12 maths physics.

And he was serious too, other one (SHubhankar) said he will do but ultimately he didnt do anything nor buy books.

So i talked with kartike more and we became close friends and class was starting to feel little fun. 

He even said to me something  like  ‘you are my best friend and i neverd had friend like you in my life and he was happy (I dont remember exact words but it really made me feel so happy and i was feeling that much happiness after so much long time of misery and pain’

[**No need to say this neccesrly**I have listened a line. You will not understand a person fully until you have a serious argument with other human. The other human may act like they are best people in world but you learn what they are really made of when you have serious argument] 

One day i was sharing him how it felt like everything happens for a reason and it feels like if things havent proceeded the way they did, i cant imagine a future where i will be in a better situation than i currently am.’

He shared to me he realized that thing long time ago. (EGOISTICAL STATEMENT BUT I WASN’T SMART ENOUGH TO NOTICE AND UNDERSTAND)

 He also felt like everything just happened to smoothly to be considered natural. And he thanked me by saying if he hadn't met me most likely he would be wasting time but now he is doing something productive. (I only remember this thing cause him praising me made me happy so i remembe4r it everything else is foggy)

I really dont know how things happened next but we happened to have lot, lots of ego fight between us.

Over everything. Maths like what is log0 or something like that or 

God- my belief was there is some superior force that guides all and that thing cant be named or talked about by us mere mortal human beings, its out of our understanding. And these names that humans speak of are all bullshit and crap created by humans. Cause human will make his gods like human or base it on animals that he sees around like monkey and elephant. I guess me saying like that would have hurt his sentiments. (And i was trying to say in a tone that will  He began to send me youtbe videos where hanumanji was captured in video and photo of mountain and showed me faces of humans in it saying that it belongs to shiva and its a proof. I responded that you will try to look through an lens fore something then it will be all you see, this is all your imagination. He also shared internet pages where it was written shiva have infinite forms but i just replied why will god mingle with humans, he should beyond such things where he comes and play with humans and even he is interfering why would we want to spread name about him and be noisy.

And our friendship just deteriorated from thereon and my mental health too slowly degraded cause i lost the illusional friend.

Shubhankar became my friend now. (He was a friend i used to hang out with cause there was no other chouce) Kartikey was angry at me and said that i have broken the close friendship of him and shubhankar and i am poaching his best friend, by using divide and conquer 

(I should have been compassionate with him) the two of them used to be such good friends but i have destroyed that because i am jealous. Khud ko jayda chalak Mt smjh, me sb kuch samjhta hun, meine itna jayda socha bhi nhi tha, mere paas wase bhi koi options thee nhi, class main Khali who dono hi backchodi main aache thee. 

KArtikey and me fighting over who has more books on discord call (We will have discord bot play music for us in background, on time he began playing moaning sounds video from youtube. It was fun)  in middle night (We used to study together on discord). I remember i was boasting to him and showing see this is xth book and suddenly my father walked in that moment and i was feeling shameful, father scolded me you dont study and talk too loudly. He can hear my voices in his room. Because i was wearing my headphone. I wasnt realizing how loud i was being and because i was boasting and competing so i had even higher voice cause i was in the moment.

(Oh, i remember on day i was just in banyan and nikkar, kartieky clicked my picture and he was laughing. Apparently sitting in chaddi banyan at home wasnt normal thing for him)

Kartikey will tell me reasons why am i doing something. And it all have a theme of i know what you are doing so dont think of yourself as cunning. I didnt knew anything he was talking about. IHe weill sday i did xyz caue of jealousy but i was always careful with jealousy and other emotions that possesses me and i may subconsiously reveal the clue sp when i will feel these emotions i prefered not to speak until they have subsidised

It almost felt like he believed he have pshycic powers and he can just read my mind

It was a really negative and bad place in mind but i had made my goal to finish my whole iit prepration before 10th clas end. So having a strong goal i gues sgive you strength to bear the sadness and misery. So i was no

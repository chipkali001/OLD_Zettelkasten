**now GRUDGE you may think.**
*unke revenge plot*
I came next day 
And told sir called my mom yesterday.
Mummy papa ne mujhe daata, they asked me not to sit yet I? 
(All in *low voice* *serious* I tried to appeared battered with tone )
Once I was done with that I was like

**Grudge wasn't actual probelm but other problem was also solved.
But something unexpected happen**
Now problem was there - too much talking and I couldn't do stuff I want to do. **Productivity low** 
I want quiet place to work do I have to sit somewhere quiet 
Want a place I can concentrate. There was kid apoorv. Wo akash iit foundation ke liye jaata tha, to yes i can focus.
**kartikey and subhankar will tell me story off**
*Theyll try to laugh at hkm and make jokes* 
*It's obvious he doens't want to relate with you. Why dont you do your own thing*
**important to show your values, morality**
It irritated me 
**My mind thought they are viscious(beekar) people(insaan)**
I didn't knew how to change that
I lacked verbal skills to shut down their behaviour.
Saying "oh dusro ko preshan nhi krna chahiye" bhot effeminate hai, but I didn't knew how to say it.
**I used to think in images feelings intuition and those things are difficult to translate**
*however however however 
**Now that was solved***
I am sitting here. They willnt speak.




Now they saw it as me betraying them. 
**I didn't saw that, it didn't clicked to me for instant, cuz in my mind I resolved everything, they do their work I do mine, in mind they were deleted in a way**

As someone who can get so fake people pleasing, we clicked amazing. I always have this fear of saying the wrong thing and I barely make REAL friends because of that, he was kind of brash and that's why I could be honest w him and it's actually so rare for me to have that kinda connection

Allow them to do for you what they do the best and then **compliment and appreciate what's unique and awesome about their style** that made you choose them.

**when selling MBti**
1) have you heard of personality models (maybe OCEAN since so popular )
2) then talk of cognitive function and personality model based on (analogy to animal sense) **then say this** you can buy way way they talk, phrasing, way of smiling, eyes movement, how smile eye moves, hand body moves, how clothes wear, behaviour **everything you can utilise to determine**


Now when I am saying types, first question is on which basis i am saying types. What is criteria and category.

The one I am trying tell is on cognitive function. 
Cognitive function are like programs on brain which we use to perceive and judge the world.there are 8 functions.
In a specific unique order and that order is fixed nd that orders decide personaly type.
**it's biological **




knowing they are misunderstanding and knowing exactly why they are misunderstanding. But annoying thing is if you be up staright they'll nh understand so you have to make them pliable enough to implant.
 Way to combact - i know why are you misunderstanding and it makes total sense but you should be atleast be open enough to **not get riled up when you have half-knowledge**
And you may even misunderstand this as me trying to justify myself? **You are too shallow and bounded by first impression.
You actually don't know why I am talking/phrasing the things I say the way I am**
*oh i know you are very smart, you don't even need to listen to anything since you already know answer to wll 
..you can just wish u half knowledge learn everything. You don't even need half knowledge cuz you know everything.*

Manipulation games

-"you are twisting my words i didn't even said that in that meaning.
What were we talking about?
Let's wait and see? What was point of our conversation.
Why did i said what i said?"

Arrogant people push their twisted logic and which throws you off as you try to Intuit where was the twist and point that out.
Solution - Say, i never said that in that context! You weren't even listentening me.

The image & intentions arrogant people assume you have is one that fullfills their ego, either by assuming you are envious or.just stupid.
They don't see.

The reason you fail with them is you don't take their motives in intution. They are looking for opportunity to just oneup themselves.
You have too much trust in their humanity and goodness.
Don't have any faith in it.

Don't show compassion to narcissist but don't act out of anger. Be ruthless 

This is story which i want to use as metaphor to explain so just don't take stroy literally and patiently wait for me to finish.

BUT BUT YOU KNOW stronger intution misleading ho skti hai kyuki 
How should I explain it.
I don't have good example but try to feel the essence
If i have to do stealing it at your home. Suppose i stole a gold something at you and hid it 
 and now i want to escape but your strong intution makes you belive i am hiding something.
So i can also steal some extra cake from your fridge too and then make
So i stole something which will be more obvious to spot and act in a way you will catch me but in a way that your intution will lead you and your intution will and narrow you in one stream but i will be in other.
I will try to act in way that satiate your intution completely.
But stealing extra cake will lead you to different image of me and place.


In context of this you can do it in any field, i can lie and hide something by making it seem what i was hiding was abc and i will try to make it so seprate that your intution will be flooding in different direction.


Are you close with your parents?
Mother or father who is closer?

THIS ALL FEELS EXTREMELY LOGICAL so MAKE THEM FEEL EMOTIONAL TO CREATE EFEECt TRyING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DEPTH not DATA COLLECTION.

Ask them to predict who you are? And who do you predicted what to you predicted?

When you try predicting theirs -ask them to depth to your logic cause i don't have experiencers memories and perception. 


What will your mind look like, if you were to describe it.
Just choose whatever setting tickles you the describe it.
Try to make it so that you can fit different facets of you in that landscape

secrets, 
hobby1, hobby2, hobby3 , ..
Friends, 
parents, 
beings/animals/pets you have special room for in that landscape, 
Your personality,
Desires, urges,
Hopes, 
Dreams etc.
Answer it in a way that you feel it is and organise it according to you. Take 10-15-30minutes as long as it take.

Se=Perseonal perception of reality
Affiliative- tip toe around the truth



ENTP though have sensing demon but with their **Ne** can notice things suoper good in other peoople, maybe not as well in themselves but in others **easily**

**Ne-people wanted me to**

Ne(Nemisis)0-You peopole want me to do that
Fi(Cricitic)

Is this how men/women really see me=Se-Te
My mom **pushes feminism**  - Te Statement
Same is my friends who are **extremly carrier focused** - Te Statement
I am giving up all hope- Ni Statement

Talking of "What i'll never do" - Ni


Girl ask- chose commerce now realise no future here, which skillset devlop how to know which?
Alakh(first starting line)- phele commerce background 
Hmare chief financial officier - commerce back - good financial so it’s not like you are saying no scope.
Look at head of branding who bought me here - he’s from commerce backgrouond.
Now here he is talking about status of some chief in his faculty 
which commerce- Te
Si - Which skillset I can only talk from my experience how i found mine
acting, then tried teaching. confused then notice i changed 10 people lives VS 100people clap. I chose 10. in college continued nukkad


I did this, i did that, 2. “mere saath ye hua mere saath wo hua” “mere saath ye hua mere saath wo hua” (in first pov, not involving anyone else) = Si 
he is talking about Ne starter type issues 
because he was good at starting a lot of things
but not able to finish them
he did nullad natak teaching, drama, etc
but he says he is confused
**thats Ni nemesis** “aisa nhi hm bhot clear hain apni zindagi ko lekar bhot clear, hm sb ek jaisa log hain, hm ki ek jaisi halat hain”
> [!Attention] 
Ni-if u give them choice they always know what they want
Ni nemesis and Ni critic worries and is critical of their choice
Ni trickster dont know what they want, they think they do but no 
and Ni demon has no permission to do what they want

Ni is focus, Si is concentration 
10min nhi pdhe 10bche aage I USED TO THINK
that is very optimistic Ne about how he says “ if you dont study for 1 hr, 100 other students are getting ahead of you who are studying ”, that is showing people long term consequence, it is also abstract
He then goes on to talkl about if you wanna cook, slice onions, YOU WON’t think of what’s brewing in other’s home, focus and occupied by present onion slice and food.
THIS IS PROGRESSION


I for some reason never like when i hear other people saying these statements
i agree . same here
it is also Ti trickster
it thinks these things can be true
so it tries ti manipulate people using these statements one thing people in india hate is falling behind naturally they get manipulated

I thought everyone just repeats what they listened somewhere else
Podcasts books
Can outcome types not be influenced atleast to that extent 
yes that would primarily be Te users
sometimes Fe users do if it is part of a social value





*I’m unworthy of (Fi statement)* **being a mom/dad (Te Statement)**
Oh people are going to think about me - Te statement   - Te is cooming in & stiumlate Fi.

You can understand someone’s nature immediately & best adjust self to get close. SO YOU AN UNDERSTAND NURTURE (Colours, experiences, etc) but nurture changes day to day - nature doesn’t. IT’S KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE.

Boss dress up, all about what he wants to do & not should do (definetly not a guardian), 
Might be artisian, and not people focusd, it’s how you feel so (NOT Idealist.)
Hard time starting, but once start finish, He is all about speed - (See it through)
ISTP & INTJ
Now he is constantly talking of future, what might be possible, what ifs, SO HE IS INTJ. ISTP is focus on what is

    hmh
    It seems like you are describing what you think about how others feel about abortion
    not how you feel about what others think of abortion
    therefore, I will conclude Ti
    so, that narrows it down to infj
    take this with a grain of salt, as I am not a professional, but that is what I think you are

  no it seemed like you described what happened pretty well
 that takes Se
 I’m an Se user, Si is my demon function so this is kinda difficult for me but I believe this is me using Si: I consumed chicken yesterday, while eating it my fiancé reminded me it has been a while since we bought the chicken. I noticed she picked it up and observed it, touching it, she noticed it had a gross somewhat slimy texture. Upon realizing I may have eaten slightly tainted chicken, I felt disgusted and threw it away with resentment. I ended up fine. (edited)

Chipkali _—_ Today at 10:30 AM
 Okay & how will Se say say the same thing. Will it be more dynamic?

gross somewhat slimy texture = Se right?

 “I felt disgusted” is my Si demon + Fi critic (edited)

**Fi**
People aren't listening to their self. You have lost touch with who you are. You are too much on social media listening to what your parent have told you, what your friends think is cool, listening to culture entertainment.
**embrace what makes you weird and different**
If you look at me at home you'll think I am weird

Why? It doesn't makes sense to me.
I can't see the connection?
You did it just because you felt like it.



**Ti- my most accurate emotios** 
people wpuld come up and be like "oh...." That is so unnecessary.
He was crying on phone and i was like ..., I was feeling bad.
With kartikey at first i felt bad. Why would you think that but when he started to read minds i was like ...
Feelings eventually evaporate. I never fight with anyone, there is no point to those emotions.i think anger, it so, it's silly.
Why is this person like this? What is this for?

Ti-Fe (Felix, ericwen)
Feel out of place from everyone.
Why am I not reacting the way other people do. Why am I not affected by things that other people are.
Sees emotions as just impresive input and output like pressing button, Lil impersonally from adar.
If I did this, this happens.
If I say this, this happens
When I did, waoh! That was storng emotional reaction.
That may look sociopathic to to ohers cause they are using emotion to push button
**playing with other emotions, maybe too excited and not taking time to figure out, maybe they are going to far with their pranks/ploys/excitment**

Q. Why is üntil my fingers are bleeding" a Se approach? Isn't that more Si cuz of the discpline and the commitment it takes? I'm confused. I know u flimed this a while ago but it would be cool if youa answer it so I understand the subject better.
Reply by TheBittenBullet
I think it more of an Ni than SI.
She ain't practicing guitar out of sense of duty/obligation but by **sense of drive**.
She wants to play it. She's following her personal desire intestead of an obligation. 
Si and Ni can be similar. They both involve commitment and determination. I think the difference is that Si is commitment ot fulfilling obligations (things they should do), whereas Ni is commitment to fulfilling one's desire (things they want to do)

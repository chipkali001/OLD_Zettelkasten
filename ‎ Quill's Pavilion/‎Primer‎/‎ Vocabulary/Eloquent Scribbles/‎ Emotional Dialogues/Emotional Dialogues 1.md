I am sorry. I was caught up in my own stuff. I should have noticed.  
I never considered your feelings.  
You know i really can't stand people like you.  
You're always thinking you know everything and you always think you have it the worst.  
Ill help though, you can thank aoi  
mettle  
Thanks Rio  
Come on then  
----  
This means a lot  
Don't be sad for me.  
I have to go back  
What for? What is there  
Why cling to something that has only bought you pain?  
Why go back?

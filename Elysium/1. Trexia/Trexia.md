**SOUL** - what makes just fact of MC being isekai different from pure fantasy (both are spending whole time in fantasy so why isekai feels better) - why marvel movies used to hit BUT now they don’t. 
CUZ they FEEL closer to REALITY. Isekai feels IT’S STILL CONNECTED TO this land. It isn’t as if it is OFF to SOME WUWU land but SOMETHING CONNECTED TO YOU, your soil.
Spider Feels like anyone can be, I can be. SUPER DUPER CLOSE to reality

Lost civilization, untrasnlatae text, mohen-jo-daro(mountain of dead, corpses distant places filled), take inspiration from India valley, Mesopotamia, & other lost civilization reality


The street walking through culture experience of Kolkata.
Someone is selling flowers
Guys over there laughing drinking tea. 
Sweet seller
Toy seller
Dancing and playing kids running through.



Perception and perception only matters.
Individual suppressed cause group say it's good/evil
(Garou one punch man, or using brutality som stopped)
Why can't I use brutality to upsurp order. When I trg to assert self they call it evil but when they use indirect force it's not.
(Mudering after betryal ex stpries)


don't force misunderstanding. Make it all know in beginning drama is going to happen.   
instead of making it MC lying to FL & feeling guil, make it as though he is just unaware (in a way) like it was with RRR.
Make both of the fall in love, hold each other dearly., unaware of fact MC’s brotheir which MC really cares about is one who slaughtered her famly.
ALSO INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THAT **CLICHE TROPE OF MC&FL Break- make it such that MC is TORN like BAHUBALI WAS, stands up, stop hiding**

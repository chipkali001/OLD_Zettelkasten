Kunal cancer incident

I know found cancer prank was bad, but i had a deep hidden passion for mischief

I said to Kunal

So you know the people whose hands are bigger than their face have more chances of catching cancer?.

He tried putting his palm on his face 

I smiled and pushes his hand more causing his nose to get squished and giving him lot of pain.

Whilr i just giggled.

This was incident of 5th class, i changed school so i was trying to try all the pranks i learned from my old school with new school friend. That time i had a mischievous personality but it was mostly suppressed by persona which i had devloped unconsciously to impress my parent and peers by acting pure, innocent, qkind and good. The natural mischief and innocent pure boy.

Some of it was reinforced by the fact it was so fulfling to act like innocent and pure cause my friends will say you are so innocent and thought like i don't understaood anything. So there was weird sense of achievement that i manage to fool everyone with innocent persona. 

He kept is head down for few seconds due to pain and when he looked up his nose was bleeding.

This had never happened before and it scared hell out of me.

Next period was english mam and she was the strictest teacher. 

Also i felt that she didn't have that good image of me? I have good image in front of almost all of my teachers but she was exception i guess. 

TEACHERS LINENT WITH ME - i am such a dilligent kid

He lied on table crossed HEADS DOWN.
And i started talking to him with Bhai and every word out of my mouth was in a soft tone (In motherly way)

mere saath chlo wrna wo mera khun kr dengi - pr wo bhi mujhe aache see smjhta thaa - aur mujhe maar khaye bina jaane nhi dega. tumhe nhi pohan to mee poch dunga

I was afraid of even asking for washroom but now i had strength to take him just seeing my friend in trouble.
He was JUST SMILLING 

I offered him my handkerchief so he can wipe blood with it, out of compassion. The thing i learned form watching shinchan and watching movie that you tie handkerchief. I offered him let's go to reception.

I was being a GOOD FRIEND who on my friend getting injured, i treating him with so much compassion, kindness, love but wo HARAMI tha mere aachaiya ki uske dil mei koi kimat nhi thi.

He was an chugalkhor person. He has complained about me to mam many times NO HE GOT PLEASURE Out of seeing me get beaten.

I tried my best to coax him with words of compassion and kindness but i failed. Mam came into the class, he went ahead and complained to her.

Mam called me ahead and unhone mujhe sunaya, i was good in study so many wo usually soft on me as compared to other kids. I was just embracing myself for the smacking/sutai. Meri sutai hone wali thi aur main khud ko ready hi kr rha tha ki.

Class main see ek bacha khada hogya aur usne bola Maine uske saath bhi 
NOW IT WAS 6th beginning & shuffling happened.
So i knew face but didnt even knew his name. At first i thought he is falsely accusing me - i dont even remeber him.
same chiz ki thio aur uske baad 5-6 dost aur hogye.




Moral of the story - dosto pe bharosa nhi kiya jaa sakta musibat ke samye koi saath nhi deta

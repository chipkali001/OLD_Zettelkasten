(16 Archetypes) x (4 sides of mind) x (4 Cognitive Function) x (Bandwidth of each function) x (Male/Female)

Every aspect of human interaction (business/sexuality/friendship/parent) is goverened by synchronicity 
Some function are more compatible & Synchronicity than other.

People live vicariously through others & judge them by their shdow/subconsious/Type-most-compatible-with-them.

**Treat others way** (their MBTI type want to be treated) **you want to be  treated**  (their MBTI type want to be treated)

Xi - Source  Xe -Consumers.      
Xe wants to consume Xi & Xi wants to consume Xe.

Parent function wants to consume Parent or Hero, not child because child is childish & inferior function lacks compatibility 

##  Se-Si
Se wants to give or take all experience, 
Se wants to give best experience to make Si user more loyal (natural). Se exist to etch experience in soul of other.
Se gets off by how Si react & act.
Se gives Si an experience, Si feels comfortable, likes that experience, so Si want to have that experience again, so Si user will want/demand repetition & this is how traditions are created.

Sometimes Se insecure what it should do, so in those times Si-Ne says
Si-Ne or Ne-Si  = Hey I have done this before you can/should do this too
Se-Ni - I want to do that.

PARTNERS SHOULD SHOULD have Se & Si opposition, otherwise it will be difficult in all dimensions (especially bed).
In bedroom you Se gets off the reaction of Si. Whearas Si is just enjoying

## Ni-Ne
Ni- ideal path for just myself, will power source, WHAT I WANT
Ne- everyone desires, wants, collective unconsious, WHAT WE WANT
Ne is always asking Ni (what are we going to do?  what we should do? hey what we want to do?) because Ni always knows what it wants & Ne seeks to give Ni what Ni wants to do
**Ne-Si (Ne is connected to duty)**
**Ni-Se (Ni is connected to giving experience)**

I want my shoes (Ni-Se)
(Ne-Si) dutifully gets those shoes
Here are your shoes (Ne-Si).
Now Ni user starts wearing them & seeing Ni user wear those shoes Ne user’s Si feels happy

Ni user always know what they want, Ne user want to give what Ni wants.
Ni all want freedom/exert-will whearas Ne user like being told what they should do.

(INFP (Fi Ne Si Te) & ENFP) & INFJ (Ni Fe Ti Se) are highest compatible.
INFJ always walk around what they want, INFP want to feel secure (Si-child) & wants them to think highly of them (Te) .
INFP always want to know what INFJ wants so there is no guessing because INFP use it as boundary, my infj lover wont like it (Si-Fi)

Now since INFP is so comfortable with what it wants (Si-child), INFJ no longer as insecurity to initiate(Se) when INFJ wants to (Ni) & In love-making to which INFP, i would love to receive that experience (Si) & i want you to do that to me (Ne).

Now in same example if it was something like Ne parent & Ni child then Ne parent wont act to whim Of Ni child cause Ni child is unsure with what they want.
Ne parent feel nice wiith NI (Parent) or Ni (Hero) - “Oh you want to save the world. ”

**INFJ is best compatible with (INFP/ENFP) FROM NATURE POV, Nurture can make other compatible BUT XNFPs are natural**

## Fi-Fe
Fe Ethics - abortion ethical because **collective (Extenral good bad)** believe its a good thing. Ethics attahed to logic.
Fi Moral - believe abortion is immoral (**INDIVIDUAL (Internal good or bad)**). Moral is attached to Rational. how community values them influence their self-believe
Fe reacts emotionally to other thoughts (Ti). I think (Ti) you feel (Fe). You feel (Fe) I think (Ti). 
I think (Ti) like THIS, you feel bad (Fe) about it, not my problem(Ti)
(ESFP, ENFP, ISFP, INFP -Parent or Hero)  (INTJ ISTJ - child) (ESTJ ENTJ - inferior) PEOPLE WITH MORAL COMPASS 

In group full of Fe, with no Fi user, now when one INTJ or ISTJ walks into the room, THEN WAY ONE INTJ/ISTJ feel is how the whole ROOM feels. Fe user are feeling vampire, they use morals of others as source and then are able to behave ethically.
If multiple Fi user then Fe user will chose someone as standard/favourite.
Fe wants to consume Fi

You want Fe & Fi dictomy in realtionship, sinec you can ask Fi user HEY HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS?. Two Fi user will critiise each other for not being good enough. Two Fe user wont ome to judgement. 
Fe user can make Fi feel better.

ENFJ (Fe Ni Se Ti)  loves INFP (Fi Ne Si Te) because its Hero-Hero Parent-Parent Child-hild Inferior-Inferior


## Ti-Te
INFP & INSTJ are always like ite your sources & evidene. It’s not about true or false but how they feel, if many people believe then they will  feel good since many people believe.
Ti logic is HOW INDIVIDUAL think. INFP ask site your soures Ti will say here SOURE & PROOF.
ENFP & ESFP dont feel smart unless they are around smart people DUE TO Te child & THEN THEY WILL FEEL BRILLIANT. To master Te you fill Te with information then it WILL FEEL GOOD.
Room of Te user, then Ti start sharing what he thinks then Te will eventually believe Ti as long as he can cite sourecs.
Te is thought vampire EAT/CONSUME/ABSORB and they eventually have potential to guide thoughts of others. ENFP & ESFP do this all the time. AS LONG AS Te gets enough Ti

In absence of explanation, perception becomes reality SO AS LONG AS ENFP & ESFP can make them feel (REFRENE POINTS & ITATIONS true) it’s true then it’s true.
QUOTE by Te user “It doesnt matter if you are gifted or not. As long as they believe you are special then you are.”

INFJ are more thinker, MBTI dont DO justice. BECAUSE Ti child, they just absorb moral standard with Fe, but Fe isn’t soure of feeling but soure of thoughts(Te)

INTP(Ti Ne) & ENTJ (Te Ni) super Compatible
ESTP (Se Ti ) & ESTJ (Te Si) super compatible

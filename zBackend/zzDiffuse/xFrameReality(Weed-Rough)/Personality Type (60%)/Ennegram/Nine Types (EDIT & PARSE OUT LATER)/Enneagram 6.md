## [Enneagram Type 6 Relationships](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-compatibility-tips/)

An Enneagram Type 6 will thrive off of relationships because of the security they bring them. Type 6s can make a relationship work well with any other Enneagram type. Each Enneagram type has different characteristics and qualities that they bring to the table, so every Enneagram relationship combination looks slightly different.  However, type six is excellent at creating bonds with all types.

-   A type 1 (The Reformer) and a type 6 have remarkably similar priorities, such as work ethic and honor. Type 1s are more decisive than type 6s, so they usually exercise leadership within the relationship. In times of trouble, 1s are more likely to become critical and serious-minded, making 6s a bit more anxious for the future of their relationship.
-   Type 2 (The Helper) and type 6 have great relationships despite prioritizing different qualities. Type 2s aim to please and foster more intimacy and positivity, while type 6 tries to maintain a secure and prosperous relationship. However, 2s and 6s need to do their best to control their emotions and autonomy. Otherwise, these two Enneagram types can push each other away.
-   Type 3 (The Achiever) and type 6 work well as a team. 3s are highly confident and optimistic, while 6s are grounded and realistic. Both types are hard workers, so they can achieve their dreams together. However, 3s and 6s have similar weak traits, which can cause the two types to become worn down by the other.
-   Type 4 (The Individualist) and type 6 are very empathetic Enneagram types, which usually bring these types together in a relationship. Together, a type 4 and a 6 are supportive of one another. A type 4 will often talk about their inner feelings and emotions, and a type 6 will be there to listen. However, since both of these types seek security and reassurance from one another, they may try to “test” the other to ensure they are loyal.
-   Type 5 (The Investigator) and type 6 are both in the Head Triad, bringing hard work and attention to detail to the relationship. Type 5s are a bit more sure of themselves, which attracts type 6s to trust them. Even though both 5s and 6s lead with their minds, they are different in accepting or rejecting ideas or authorities, which can cause problems between the two types.
-   When two type 6s come together, they bring their hardworking and trusting qualities to the table. They can give each other the mutual love and support that they need. However, two type 6s can also negatively affect the relationship since they have the same downfalls. Two type 6s might react emotionally and act out of fear with one another.
-   Type 7 (The Enthusiast) is also in the Head Triad along with type sixes. Even though these two types can counterbalance each other, sometimes they can have difficulty understanding one another because type 7 will be more optimistic about ideas, whereas type 6 will be more realistic. Type 7 is more visionary while type 6 is more practical, but both traits make a great team because type 7 can use their creativity, and type 6 can use their practical senses to keep the type 7 more grounded.
-   Type 8 (The Challenger) and type 6 can be skeptical of the world, bringing them together. Type 8 is much more direct and willing to make decisions, and type 6s gladly support their efforts. However, since 8s are more decisive, they can become worn out with a 6’s indecisiveness.
-   The final Enneagram type 9 (Peacemaker) and type 6 both want security in relationships, which is why this is a ubiquitous pairing. They both tend to be easy-going types, but 9’s will be more optimistic, and type 6’s can be more skeptical. However, since they are both people-pleasers, sometimes these two types may drift apart by fulfilling social roles.

Man or woman, we have all peed in weird places. Time to hear their story!

Time to find out what skeletons they have in their closet.

50. What horrible thing have you done that no one else found out about?

Time to find out where the bodies are buried! I mean, the metaphorical bodies. I hope they aren’t real bodies. Finding out your friend is murderer would probably put a damper on the party.

While love, lust, and romance are great, they can really lead to some sticky situations. Pardon the pun.

Always a good one to bust out, I’m sure they have some kind of embarrassing text messages on their phone. Whether it be embarrassing for them or for the other person, it’ll be fun for the group.

TRUTH OR DARE: DARES LIST

And when they don’t want to tell you the truth we’ve got this lovely list of dares for you.

1. Serenade the person to your right.

Be as animated as possible! Falling to your knees, arms gesturing wildly, make sure to go over the top and then some.

2. Talk in an accent for the next 3 rounds.

The hard part isn’t the accent, it’s remembering to keep up the accent for the whole 3 rounds. Feel free to impose a penalty if they don’t make it.

3. Kiss the person to your left.

The type of kiss will vary a lot depending on what type of party it is. Do what feels right.

4. Attempt to do a magic trick.

It’s especially entertaining if the person has never done any magic tricks.

5. Do four cartwheels in row.

For the love of whoever’s house it is, make sure there is enough room for four cartwheels.

6. Let someone shave part of your body.

Okay, so if you want to be nice you can let them choose. But warn them, if it’s not acceptably humorous then the group will decide.

7. Eat five tablespoons of a condiment.

Let them choose the condiment. Whatever condiment they choose will probably still be pretty enjoyable to watch.

8. Be someone’s pet for the next 5 minutes.

This one is bit on the weirder side, so feel free to give it a miss. But if the “pet” and “owner” get into it, it can be quite funny.

9. Attempt to break dance for 30 seconds.

Oddly enough, this one might be the one that gets people injured the most. So, limber up and be careful. Wrists are fragile things, and people believe they can do a lot more than they actually can.

10. Let the group give you a new hairstyle.

So, let the person decide if cutting / shaving is an option. Much hilarity can be had with hair gel or hair spray. But if there isn’t any of that available, honey or perhaps mayo might do interesting things with hair.

11. Do the worm.

Everyone knows the worm. Very few people can do it. Always entertaining to see people fail at doing it.

12. Curse like sailor for 20 seconds straight.

Usually best saved for the more reserved and innocent of the group.

13. Sniff the armpits of everyone in the room.

Sure, it’s gross. But it’s truth or dare, what do you expect? Just hope that everyone in your group has good hygiene habits.

14. Dance to a song of the group’s choosing.

One of the more lighthearted and easy tasks. Just make sure they dance through the whole thing.

15. Take a shower with your clothes on.

Make sure to take out your keys and cell phone!

16. Break two eggs on your head.

Sure, you might expect an egg joke here, but we are way too classy for that. We like to defy eggspectations.

17. Do your best impression of a baby being born.

This one can be really great if you’ve got a theater major in the group or someone who likes performing.

18. Belly dance like your life depended on it.

Music helps. Why would your life depend on belly dancing? Who knows, weirder things have happened.

19. Put 4 ice cubes down your pants.

Make sure to spread them out a bit for maximum jiggling around effect.

20. Lick the floor.

Time to kick that immune system up a notch! The gross factor on this one varies greatly depending on how clean the host is.

21. For a guy, put on makeup. For a girl, wash off your make up.

This is always a fun one, make sure they keep it on or off for the whole game.

22. Dance with no music for 1 minute.

Again, it helps if you give this on to someone in the group who likes being the center of attention.

23. Try to drink a glass water while standing on your hands.

Of course, they’ll need a bit of help with the water but I’m sure someone from the group will be more than happy to give them a helping hand.

24. Let the group pose you in an embarrassing position and take a picture.

How good this one turns out depends entirely on how creative the group is.

25. Play a song on by slapping your butt cheeks till someone guesses the song.

Sure, it’s a lot easier to guess if it’s simple but it can be a lot more fun if they go for something a little more complex.

26. Give someone your phone and let them send one text to anyone in your contacts.

So, this one, this one can be dangerous. Don’t send any life destroying texts, it’s just a game after all.

27. Depict a human life through interpretive dance.

Similar to the giving birth one, make sure to give this one to one of the more animated people in your group for maximum entertainment.

28. Drink a small cup or shot of a concoction that the group makes. (Don’t make anything that might cause bodily harm. No visits to the emergency room.).

Seriously, stick to condiments. The importance of not poisoning your friends can’t be overstated.

29. Write or draw something embarrassing somewhere on your body (that can be hidden with clothing) with a permanent marker.

Again, it depends on the creativity of the group for the success of this dare.

30. Make every person in the group smile, keep going until everyone has cracked a smiled.

I love this one because it leads to increasing levels of hilarity while people try to keep a straight face. Always a good choice.

31. Let the person to your left draw on your face with a pen.

No permanent markers for this dare, we are going for mild private humiliation, not public humiliation.

32. Make up a 30 second opera about a person or people in the group and perform it.

Bust out your best opera voice but try not to kill those vocal cords or make the neighbors too angry.

33. Beg and plead the person to your right not to leave you for that other boy or girl. Weeping, gnashing of teeth, and wailing is encouraged.

Doesn’t matter if they are a couple or not, this one is always a blast to watch.

34. Do pushups until you can’t do any more, wait 5 seconds, and then do one more.

Who knew truth or dare could be a good workout as well!

35. Sell a piece trash to someone in the group. Use your best salesmanship.

Creativity makes this one great or fall flat on its face, so choose your victim wisely.

36. Let the group look through your phone for 1 minute.

Oh, this one can be dangerous. Let the treasure hunt begin! Will you find something hugely embarrassing or come up with nothing? Only one way to find out!

37. Switch clothes with someone of the opposite sex in the group for three rounds.

No need to strip down in front of everyone, you can always strip down in separate rooms with an intermediary passing clothes back and forth. Whatever everyone is comfortable with.

38. Imitate a celebrity every time you talk for three minutes.

Either have the group choose the [celebrity](https://www.randomlists.com/random-celebrities) or let them pick so you can get their best impression.

39. Try to juggle 2 or 3 items of the group’s choosing.

Remember the number one rule, no one goes to the ER. So, no chainsaws or anything like that.

40. Stick your arm into the trash can past your elbow.

For some this one will be no problem, so for maximum effect save this one for one of your friends who is especially germophobic.

41. Walk on your hands from one side of the room to the other. You can ask someone to hold your legs if necessary.

I know I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. Try not to get any permanent injuries or break a bunch of stuff in your host’s place.

42. Gargle something that shouldn’t be gargled but won’t hurt you.

Emphasis on the won’t hurt you. May I suggest some mayo or perhaps some Siracha?

43. Get slapped on the face by the person of your choosing.

Your life is your own, but I would recommend choosing the weakest one in the group. You might think your good buddy will go easy on that slap, but there is a good chance they won’t.

44. Grab a trash can and make a hoop with your hands above the trash can. Have other members of the group try to shoot trash through your impromptu trashketball hoop.

Be the backboard. No bottles or other injury causing trash should be thrown. Once again, no trips to the hospital please. Also, you might want to figure out some time or trash limit for this one.

45. Spin an imaginary hula hoop around your waist for 3 minutes while the game continues.

They got off easy with this dare, so make sure they go full on hula hoop, no slacking off.

46. Imitate popular YouTube videos until someone can guess the video you are imitating.

Also, no talking, basically think YouTube charades.

47. Seduce a member of the same gender in the group.

This one can go in a lot of fun directions, especially if some of the group or the dare taker are part of the LGBTQ community. And if you are LGBTQ, don’t pick your partner if they are playing the game with you.

48. Compose a poem on the spot based on something the group comes up with.

Are you more of a Shakespeare or more of a Robert frost?

49. Poll dance for 1 minute with an imaginary pole.

If you are playing while drinking this can be pretty hilarious, just don’t fall and break yourself or something else.

50. Attempt to walk on your elbows and knees for as far as you can.

Might want to give this on a pass if you have a particularly hard floor.

51. Choose someone from the group to give you a spanking.

Again, I would recommend choosing wisely, and maybe coming up with a limit.

52. Post an extremely unflattering picture of yourself to the social media outlet of your choosing.

Depending on how into social media they are, this could be an easy one for them or a really painful one.

53. Make a funny face and keep making it for 2 minutes while the game continues.

You’d be surprised how hard it is to hold some funny faces for a long time.

54. Imagine something in your room. Now spell it with your nose and keep spelling it with your nose until someone from the group guesses what you are trying spell.

Another silly one that is pretty harmless but a lot of fun to watch.

55. After the group chooses one word, sing a song and insert that word once into every line of the song.

Remix! Let’s see how creative they can get. Hopefully they’ll at least try to make it make sense.

56. Drag your butt on the carpet like a dog from one end of the room to the other.

Move it Fido! Does anyone really call their dog Fido or Spot or Rover anymore?

57. Open a bag of snacks or candy using only your mouth, no hands or feet.

Tricky, but doable, and highly entertaining to watch. But expect a mess.

58. Bend at the waist so that you are looking behind you between your legs. Now run backwards until you can tag someone with your butt.

Who doesn’t love an impromptu game of butt tag? I don’t know why, but this one cracks me up.

59. Make a tea out of something that isn’t tea (but is NOT dangerous or toxic) and drink it.

And no, cereal in milk isn’t cereal tea. But may I suggest you check out the spice rack or perhaps they might prefer some Dorito tea?

60. Go to the bathroom, take off your underwear and put it on your head. Wear it on your head for 10 minutes.

Let’s just hope their underwear isn’t too nasty. For their sake and yours!

61. Act like whatever animal someone yells out for the next 1 minute.

Depending on the enthusiasm of the person doing the dare, this can lead to a good amount of cardio.

62. Eat one teaspoon of the spiciest thing you have in the kitchen.

This one depends a lot on how much the host likes spicy stuff. Don’t forget to film their reaction for posterity!

63. Transfer an ice cube from the person on the right’s mouth to yours.

If one or both isn’t into mouth to mouth contact, there is also the artillery approach.

64. Call the 7th contact in your phone and sing them 30 seconds of a song that the group chooses.

Another roll of the dice. Who is that seventh contact? A friend? A family member? A restaurant?

65. No talking. Pretend to be a food. Don’t pretend to eat the food, pretend to be the food. Keep pretending until someone in the group guesses the food you are.

Probably one of the more ridiculous ones on the list but it can be fun.

66. Drop something in the toilet and then reach in to get it.

Perfect for germaphobes! How clean is the host’s toilet? Time to find out!

67. Find the person whose first name has the same letter as your first name or whoever’s first name’s first letter is closest to yours. Now lick their face or let them lick your face, their choice.

Not sure who is worse off, the licker or the lickee but definitely no winners here.

68. Sit in a spinning chair and have the group spin you for 30 seconds. Might help to hold a trash can just in case.

For some it will be fun and for some sickening, but make sure they don’t go through any coffee tables when they stand up.

69. Jump up and down as high as you can go for a full minute.

More cardio! Don’t let them slack off.

70. Let two people give you a wet willy at the same time.

I’m sure somewhere there is a person who likes wet willys but I’ve never met anyone who has. Time to get wet n’ willy!

71. Sing a praise song about a person of the groups choosing.

Nothing like a good ballad, and if you can give the person some music, all the better!

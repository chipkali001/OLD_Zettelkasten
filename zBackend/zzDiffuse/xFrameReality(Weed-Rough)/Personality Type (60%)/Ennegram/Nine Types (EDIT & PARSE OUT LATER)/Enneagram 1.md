Typically, you can identify the characteristics of an enneagram within their work on a project or career.   Their attention to detail and ability to create a structure to accomplish tasks is uncanny.

The motives of an enneagram type 1 come from a strong desire to justify and direct their passions into something they believe to be correct. An enneagram one exists within the [Gut Triad](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-triads/), and their motivation comes from a fear of being evil or wrong.

Because an enneagram one sees anger as an undesirable trait, this creates internal turmoil to process. Often a strong sense of anger can brood under the surface when their improvement efforts aren’t enough. Their desire for integrity coupled with unresolved frustration can be troubling.

An unhealthy Enneagram type 1 will be unable to focus on achieving their goals and express frustration when their strict expectations are unmet.   Even so, they will look for others to blame rather than take responsibility for bettering their lives.

Concerning their goals, an unhealthy one can become an obsessive workaholic. This pattern can develop depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders leading to breakdowns.

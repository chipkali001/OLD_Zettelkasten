USE 
1. Manipulate inferior by using it’s introversion/extroversion inverse (Fe→Fi, Ni→Ne)
2. nemisis, critic, demon - to convince hero, parent, child
3. Trickster - to hit by suprise, cant see it coming

ISTP (Ti hero) Boss - How do you tell him, his idea his stupid?

1. Ti
2. Se
3. Ni
4. Fe
5. Te (nemisis)
6. Si (critic)
7. Ne (Trickster)
8. Fi (demon)
Ti difficult to shake it’s logic. ITS HERO
But Fe(inferior) - wants acceptance use Ni.
Then stimulate Fi, Si, Te
Boss unaware of Ne - future possibility of action, but

“you know i dont **feel (Fi)** (to attack inferior good about this, what about this happens & that (Ne blindspot - what is dont see what if)”

.....
ESFP: denial, selective inattention, humor, feigning confusion, feigning innocence, minimization, exaggeration. Their language will distort the truth when they try to persuade people; and when they commit a wrong, they may try to get out of it either by playing it down or claiming that they never meant any harm to begin with.
ESTP: lying, shaming, provocation, feigning innocence, humor, minimization, exaggeration. They may lie to cover their tracks. To establish dominance they will use shaming language; and to escape consequences for their actions, they will play down their abuse, or re-frame it as a joke. At worst, they will deliberately gaslight the victim.
ESTJ: intimidation, shaming, provocation, vilifying the victim. Their go-to tactic is intimidation, but they may shame victims; and they may even taunt their victims when they are in a position of powerlessness. Their tactics are not as versatile, but they come off strong.
ESFJ: flattery, splitting, smear campaigns, triangulation, poisoning the well, reinforcement, the silent treatment. They may dole out flattery to win some influence with the victim; but they also have a tendency to gush with genuine compliments to reward behavior they deem appropriate (positive reinforcement). They may launch smear campaigns to try to isolate the victim and harm their reputation; then follow up by communicating their demands through the victim’s friends (triangulation), or at worst pit their own friends against them (splitting).
ISFP: secrecy, playing the victim role, guilt-tripping, the silent treatment. They are usually not very manipulative, but they can be persuasive. Their manipulation usually centers around their own impression management, and concealing information; they’re the mostly likely to say “I don’t want to talk about it”. If they are artists, they may try to sublimate their messages into their art. They may be deliberately obscure in their communication to frustrate their opponent into leaving them alone.
ISTP: selective inattention, the silent treatment, feigning confusion, secrecy, denial, lying, minimization. Their manipulation is defined by their non-responsiveness to criticism. If their behavior causes problems and others point it out, they may simply ignore these remarks. They may pretend as if their behavioral problems do not exist.
ISTJ: avoidance, the silent treatment, shaming, guilt-tripping. They are probably the least manipulative of all types. They could learn any kind of manipulation tactic and use it ruthlessly, but they are not naturally drawn to any tactic in particular. They are prone to social policing every now and then, in which event they may use language to shame or guilt-trip those who do not conform to their ideals. In most situations in which they feel threatened, they are more likely to detach altogether than employ a manipulation tactic.
ISFJ: playing the servant role, guilt-tripping, shaming, self-victimization passive aggressiveness, reciprocity. They may act like they are there to help the victim so as to gain trust, then use their newfound influence to try to change the victim; or they may do something nice, then extort the victim’s sense of reciprocity to emotionally bribe them. They are also prone to guilt trips.
ENFP: humor, distraction, poisoning the well, self-victimization, flattery. They usually don’t manipulate, but they are capable of any emotional manipulation tactic. They tend to defuse criticism with humor. Their main tactic is distraction—because they are normally so unfocused, their attempts at changing the focus of attention often fly under the radar.
ENTP: provocation, humor, shaming, exaggeration, minimization, rationalization. Their tactics are geared toward trolling. They are experts at provoking the anger of their victims to disarm of them of their logical faculties; they then argue their opponent into circles, then use humor to win the favor of their audience. To further absolve themselves of responsibility, they may offer a twisted justification for their behavior—e.g. that they were doing the victim a favor by challenging the victim’s beliefs.
ENFJ: flattery, playing the servant role, triangulation, humor, vilifying the victim, poisoning the well, smear campaigns. Woe to anyone who makes a true enemy of this type. Most of the time, their manipulation is benign, and they justify it by claiming to help the victim. At the absolute worst, they can isolate the victim from friends, convincing them that the victim is the problem, then stage an “intervention” on the victim’s behalf.
ENTJ: intimidation, provocation, rationalization, vilifying the victim. They don’t rely on manipulation tactics as much as charisma; they use persuasive language and rhetoric, and they naturally project confidence. They take initiative to maneuver into a position of power, where they have less need for such tactics. They may employ tactics to maneuver into that position or to maintain it—such as intimidating their opponents, or provoking them such that they lose composure—however they tend to dispense with these once they are in power.
INFP: self-victimization, projecting the blame, guilt-tripping, shaming. They normally will not manipulate, but if they do it usually has a moral element. They are masters at playing the victim. For anything that may be wrong with them, they have the uncanny ability to displace the blame onto something else—usually society, or their opponent.
INTP: avoidance, selective inattention, rationalization, self-victimization. They are usually not motivated to manipulate. If they are threatened, they will usually withdraw or ignore their opponent. They can usually offer a justification for their behavior. Sometimes they will play the victim role to get others on their side, but sadly this position is justified more often than not.
INTJ: rationalization, distraction, secrecy, triangulation, lying, avoidance, intimidation. This type has an extraordinary potential for manipulation (which may or may not be actualized) because they possess Ni. They can rationalize anything, including their opponent’s behavior. They can usually tell where a conversation is going and can divert it long before it arrives there. It is possible for them to manipulate circumstances without their opponent even realizing they exist—they are the most likely to conspire against their opponents, while at the same time avoiding a direct confrontation with them. They also possess the death glare, which avails them of some intimidation.
INFJ: distraction, secrecy, avoidance, humor, flattery. This type is said to be among the most potent manipulators, because they possess Ni. They typically use covert tactics in a conversational setting. Their favorite is to steer the conversation using questions, keeping the focus of attention on their interlocutor while remaining secretive about themselves. Under the guise of curiosity, in a sort of “unstructured” interview, they lead their opponent to a predetermined conclusion. They may defuse conflict with humor, and instill a sense of trustworthiness by doling out compliments.

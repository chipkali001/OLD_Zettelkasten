In class 5 I cried in dance preparation from annual day (participation was necessary) becoz i was too embarrassed to dance with

I was trying my best to hold back my tears (don't cry, don't cry) but tears eventually came and won't stop. It's really embarrassing to cry in front of whole class in 5th. It was only 8-9 months spend in school so i was still quite new in school so what impression of me this will leave

However after that i left the dance and noone coerced me to do it.

Mam then next day said to me that if i till i dont partake in the dance, noone in class is allowed to.talk to me. Mam thought the reason i wasn't participating cause i was introvert so mam wanted me to go beyond my boundaries but i was feeling so embarassed.

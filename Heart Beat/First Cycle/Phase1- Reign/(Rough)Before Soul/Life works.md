# CREATIVITY & CREATION

## GAME CREATION
Tried create group to make game together and teach them (laser , leo, daksh, etc) but pubg too addicting that they can't focus, i couldn't teach, i tried and they feklt it's complicated bailing out, i asked them to do environemnt, map building.

I had strong vivid imagination in childhood and I really loved zombie apocalypse movies, where suddenly the world is infected, the world is in chaos, society has collapsed completely, so surviving under that, I really loved daydreaming day and night about it. I was filled with so much excitement when i will think. 

I will often even feel sad over the fact that my daydreaming will always remain a dream because that excitement I was looking for can’t be found in the real world.

BUT THEN I SUDDENLY SAW VideoGamesCreation as a way to make my fantasy come to reality, i can bring some of that exhilaration, fear, excitement through turning my fantasy into video game. 

Tried creatin game with new team, i poached people from YoutubeComments, FromThereToWhatsapp, ThenToDiscord, but most people were just wuwu they didn’t have computer well equipped and in end i finally met a capable person SahadAhmed was his name maybe. He was studying C++ in college, he delayed lot of time due to his exams coming up then drivers not supporting.

 But he created awesome facebook page, our Game Creatn Group Name was earlier OmegaGames which we changed to hexlan studious, logo was a red skull, we talked a lot about story of game, i wanted to create a zombie game

I also poached a second person from facebook group, i asked if some 3D Modeller wants to work, he sent me his resume, i told him we are just developing a first time indie game.

ALSO ACTUALLY THE REASON I WAS WORKING AND PUTTING SO MUCH EFFORT ON GAME HAD MOTIVATION

-I have loved video games cause they were only thing that gave me enjoymewnt for almost my whole childhood, i felt outdoor games were super-duper boring, school boring, except 3yrs where i really was eager to go to school enjoy. I wanted to create video games ever since i first started playing GTA Vice City and the reason was somewhat was that when in school or outdoor i used to get bored i will close my eyes and imagine myself inside game and it was really engaging and really enjoyable way to spend time, i can cutoff my senses from reality and drown in seas of my imagination. 

The way to make that fantasy or vision in my head to reality was through creating game.

But my father didn’t taught me nor gave me any sources that will allow me to learn to create game but again i was really small at that time 1st 2nd 3rd 4th CLASS, so father mustn’t have weight to my words.  

But now i realized, that much better way to quench that desire of creating tjat imaginary world into reality was through novels but my mother, father noone gave me or encouraged me to try a novel or interesting non-fiction books. Even though my father has deep interest for non-fiction book he didnt bothered to inculcate that and my mother in college used to write articles that used to get publish in newspaper maybe so she was a well read person but she too didnt bothered and i am kind of pissed my parents for that.

They focused on my growth in Science and Maths & they didn’t bothered to help me develop and improve my drawing skill or reading. They could have bought me a book that teach me how to draw better so i can learn by myself.

I remember i really loved taking to saransh bhiya about what if zombei took over, how will we live, i told hhim i want to base off map from our colony. I will talk fro hours and hours about different scenarios that will come to my mind and i will at end of it feel really refreshed.

I also used to tell devrath and arpan about i will also add my school in my video game map, i will talk about how cool it would be - imagine school at night everything is dark, one bulb is flickering on and off, it suddenly tyurns off and when it opens zombie is in front of you, how hide in class and it was really crazy how i can go on for hours talking about this stuff,.

I FELT IT WAS FORCEFULLY SNATCHED FROM ME BY WORLD FOR SOMETIME

1. I was in class6th, 10-11years, and it was maybe games/AV period & in that time frequent stealing system of one kid stay, my best-friend monitor and i made him give his privelige to me. So i used to stay.
2. Now on that day in games period, i was naturally supposed to take duty, but now a girl from our bus Somya she came to Ayush and told she wants to stay. Ayush told her & me two of us can decide who will stay
3. Only one person can stay and We decided to not decide
4. I was sitting on my seat doing maths equation in middle row & somya was sitting near window open window, it was big enough some human can easily jump and there were no stoppers, really you can jump and  it was first floor and below there were plants & bushes, and just below our room was principal room, so i dont think someone will get badly injured
5. she had bag of her firend in her hand & you know there are keychains of plastic where you sew 3-4 colourfu l thread and add it to key-chain. Somya was doing time-pass messing/chedna with that.
6. Aur wo khelte khelte gir gayi.
7. Okay nhi giri, ussne mujhe mule bulaya, mene uske taraf dekha to uska ek haath niche thaa ltka hua jisme usne bag pakad rkha tha.
8. Usne mujhse pucha ‘gira du?’ obviously playful/joke tone mai
9. I played along ki ‘feek du?’
10. Huhuhu Lightly (do it for little)-(build up laughter in then)
11. I went back to my work, little while passed & i heard a thump sound.
12. I looked towards her was there standing with both hands on face (oh face)
13. She was just looking down, she didnt say anything to me. I looked for bag and it wasnt anywhere.
14. So i went to window where she is and peeked down, bag was on it’s face. 
15. I asked her **jaau lau**
16. She no 
17. I pushed jau tumne hi giraya hai
18. No
20. She asked for me to bring it for her
21. Tumne giraya hai tum hi laugi
22. She then said - she will tell mam i told her throw it down
23. I WAS SUPRISED SHE COULD SAY THAT and deep down i knew iska koi bharaosa nhi
24. I TRIED TO make her go and convince her
25. But she launched SATYAGRAH & WENT on a strike by doing SOONE KA NATTAK on her seat
26. I sat down, on my seat continuing maths, DO YOU KNOW AGLA PERIOD kiska tha? YES ENGLISH MAM
27. MAM will TAKE AWAY MY RIGHT TO STAY Ssicne it was supposed to be my duty, she willn’t do ki masum padhne wala sanskari bcha hai iski kya glti. 
28. PERMANENT BAN or Maybe call to my parents (Worse). I used to take pride in fact till now, there had never been complain of me to my parents (except i talk b/w periods) & I WAS PRAISED i am so sincere & sanskari boy & i took pride in that. Now  pheli shikayat hogi ki    aapka bacha ldkiyo ke bag fekta hai khidki see
29. Fuck I have to do something.
30. i again tried to make her go but pr uska SATYAGRHA chalu tha
31. I have to do something ‘okay i will go’ 
32. Now for going we required a pass, that gle me latkane ke liye when you go out COMPULSARY. i honesltly didnt like putting it on my gala and going around
33. **When i was going prepare somya asked me to take pass** & i was like no mera ego bhot bda hai gle mei pass ltka kee ghumne mei, shuu shuu, people like me go without pass.
34. I FELT SO NICE TO ACT LIKE THAT.
35. So there i went and i just had gone few steps, thoda aage hi and the last person that i wanted to see, my-nemisis , SPORTS TEACHER entered the corridor and was coming in my direction
36. Now when we were at close to that talking distance, before he can say anything, i said good morning sir properly bowed.
37. I didnt gave him chance to say anything, went close to him, touched his feet and very properly with both hands touched his feet, again good morning sir bowed & went away slowly.
38. SAFE
39. actually i figured out it long time ago in 4th, 5th class, that if you act respectfully towards someone they will want good opinion of you & willn’t want to do anything that wil shake that and asking for pass is kind of like testing loyalty? ACTUALLY THIS STRATEGY i came up with when after a physical fight or prank . I Know he holds amnosity & will find oppotunity to take revenge on me so 
	1. My strategy was pretend as if it never happened
	2. Treat them lot of humility and praise them alone and in public. 
	3. Meke them feel really cool & respected, and kids have such big ego & noone really treats anyone nicely 
	4. They will forget in few days 
40. COMING BACK TO STORY
41. it just clicked to me, IT’S A GIRL’S BAG & it will be apparently clear when i take it with me & how am i supposed to explain this to sir? and i was kind of insecure of my voice WHICH impeded my ABILITY to devlop ability to BE SMOOTH & PLAY WITH WORDS TO GET MY WORK DONE. 
42. I decided to RETREAT. but now since i have come this far i sighed, there was spot near where there was chilled water & it was on outside location on first floor so from there i just enjoyed wind, view & came back
43. Somya asked me **kya hua?**
44. **Mei pani peene gaya tha**
45. Just i sat down adn did maths & i was again thinking of will she tell to mam? now since she has declared that she will say…, she gets an excuse to do it with less inhibition and say i told you so. If she hadn’t told me that, chances would have been lowered.
46. And just mam aayi.
47. Phir jis ldki ka bag tha wo aayi, jb usne somya see pucha usak bad kha hai, somya nee usse bola ki mene feka, mene usse bola mene kuch nhi kiya, usne mam ko jakar bola mene feka, mene mam ko bola mene nhi feka,
48. Mam ne phir bhi mujhe bola tum lau ( i was like Loo, HOW IS IT ANY DIFFERENT FROM IF I HAD BOUGHT IT MYSELF, I am so tupid, i could have bought it myself)
49. But before i had chance to go an maid bought the bag
50. EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER

my ego is too big to wear something like that
secret coop mission & i will

Me pani pi kr aagya, me wapas see apna whi maths ka krke soch rha tha ki jo bhi hoga court me dekha jayga




















In our class was a girl who was how should I say mentally disturbed and was overflowing with energy.

~~(I will call her Mukesh)~~ NO THIS ONLY CREATE SUSPICON

—------------- 

Mukesh and I was in class talking about something *dont remember* . mukesh was sitting in front of the window she grabbed the bag which belonged to the girl who was sitting on a desk which was just in front of the window. (playing with that plastic string type thing which you tie in the chain of the bag), 

Few minutes later she held the bag down with it strap holding her hand outside the window    

she asked gira du?

Bee tone was not serious and she had this kind of personality too, As i said she was mad person .

So i felt that she isn't serious and she is just being playful.

(There was time when we were bunking on bahana of robotics practice she went outside and was watching xyx from top floor while leaning and then a teacher from down cslld her)

Fee seconds later there was dhum sound and when  i turned around she was laughing or maybe covering her mouth with both hands something 'aaww' like that i dont reeber exactly.

I looked outside through the window and the bag was safely lying on the bushes in front of the principal's office.

I urged her to go get the bag but mysteriously somehow she said that she will take my name too and put blame on me and i didn't have trust in her so i knew she will just push the blame on me.

It was my unlucky day because next period was english and that mam was very very strict and chuglikhor person. She will tell complains to others teacher too and from them it can even reach my parent.

I was really cowardly so i didnt have courage that i will try to justify myself in front of that mam when all the kids in the class will be looking at everything like a comedic skit + i had lot of insecurity about voice stuff so i just wouldnt be able to mutter more than few words.

Me buri tarike see daar gaya

What will happen if news reach my parents.

I was a good sanskari boy, never complaint from the teacher. I urged her to go and pickup the bag.

I didn't have trust in her, i knew that yee Phasegi to mujhe bhi phasa degi iska koi bharosa nhi

She ignored me.

Yee bhi Phasegi 

i had an image to maintain in front of my parents. I can't let a complaint go to my home. What will i reply when they ask why i was skipping class?

(Also i didn't had courage to confront madam (main reason was that i feared made fun of due to mispronunciation))

I mustered up courage and decided to go get the bag.

And in those time we had a pass. You have to put it around your head. If you are found without it outside of class. You will be punished. II found that very cartoonish. I had an ego that and was not ready to wear something like that so i just left it in class. I am too cool to take this with me.

I only walked a few steps in the corridor and at the our sports teacher was in front.

I got scared, and decided quickly. 

I put on an innocent smile and expression.

Greeted good morning and bowed my head respectfully. before he asks m, where am I going? Or where is my pass? 

I quickly ducked and touched his feet. Said thankyou sir and then went away.

Teacher ke pair chune Wale bhi kitne bcche hote hain to sir bhi rajji hogye honge

(well my quick response was becoz of a strategy i built from school fights. In class 5th, i was taller and more fatter than most of my classmates so it was easier for me to beat anyone in fights but after beating i knew they will hold a grudge against me for the humiliation and they may act out resentment in other forms or kaand krenge jo sayad mujhe pasand naa aaye if not physical so it was essential to poke hole is to praise them and say good things about them act over friendly nice and kind and just feed their ego afterall little kids rarely get respect so they most of the time liked it . So similar things happened with sir that behind the mask of friendliness and respect the thought that i am hiding something from him will never even cross his mind.)

Bowed a little and then i went towards washroom side.

All my motivation and resolved disappeared

I realised “Mujhse naa ho payega”

I came back and told her I can't get the bag.

I began studying again

All students came back  and took their seats.

She and her friend started debating over the bag.

Her friend went and reported it to maam.

I and Mukesh both called out to maam.

Mukesh was actually a social butterfly and master at communication (I used to think she just have genetics). She was somehow able to persuade mam. When mam asked me to go and get the bag. A  bhiya comes and handover bag (Bag had name and class written on it)

Mummy story


One time mom went with badi buaa to buy dress and in the end when they selected all the best dress they hoarded and kept all the best dresses of all to herself.


And even in earlier times, when badi buaa used to gift mother good dresses grandmother and SEEMA buaa will open her stuff and take it even without permission and when mom ask grandmother says “what will you do of this dress?”

Mummy gifts her best dress to Buaa (father’s sister) and mami (MOTHER’s brother’s wife) but in return buaa gives her dresses that she has worn for few years and now they are old and mami gave her 500rs cheap dress that you gift to maid on special festivals. This infuriates mom.
‘What to do they even think of me?’
Mom always think of giving the best gift but other people only put their own interest first

There was a dress mom liked very much. She refused to give that badi bua. The occasion of raksha bandhan came and mom, dad decided to give choti bua money for rakhi but when the time to give money came. Grandmother intruded and said that you don’t give money on these auspicious occasions and the circumstances just happen to align in such a way that mom had to give up her dress


MANY TIMES GRANDMOTHER WILL TAKE MOTHER’s stuff and forget it that she took it and after that when mom will be worried and search where is her stuff. Grandmother will blame it on mom saying she stole it but after search they will mom’s stuff in grandmother’s bag.

When others will praise mom’s effort for serving grandmother and grandfather. Grandmother will say to other that ‘’she is in it for money. She THINK when the old hag dies. she will leave some money for her’

MOM CONTINUES TO TRY HER BEST TO DO HER DUTIES OR MAYBE PLEASE (I don’t know) all these people but in the end they demonize mom and will put false blame and allegations on her.

Mom believes what difference will remain between me and them if I were to treat them the same way they treat me. Gotta stick to my principles

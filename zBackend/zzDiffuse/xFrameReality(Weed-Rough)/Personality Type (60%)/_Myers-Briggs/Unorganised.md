IN MBTI the Middle Two Functions being same makes up for awesomne bond.       

The outer Two being different adds in different way.

INTUTION & SENSING DIFFERENCE CAN BE WORKED AROUND IN RELATIONSHIP BUT FEELING AND THINKING BEING SAME IS FOR BEST FOR BOTH 

  

ADD DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE FROM DIFFERENT MBTI PERSONALITY & ENNEGRAM BEHAVIOURS, what is their normal life experience and relatable experience.

Create a doc for each of 16 MBTI & ENNEAGRAM

WHICH YOU CAN LATER REFRENCE TO WHEN CREATING CHARACTER OYU VSN JUST PICK ONE ONE OUT OF 16 and one out o f ennegram and BOOM  
A lively character you have.

INTERNALIZE THEM YOURSELF TOO SO YOU CAN USE THEM & BECOME GOD TOO ON SPONTAINENITY AND PREDICT PEOPL BEHAVIOUR AND SAY THINGS THAT WILL RESONATE WITH THEIR MBTI TYPE.

  

J Types are best for trust due to strong values, they will stand up, plan ahead.  

For P types you have to slowly slowly conquer them slowly slowly reveal your cards

  

This has been studied. Not through MBTI, but through the Big Five - and Big Five and MBTI have a strong correlation. See All the Dark Triad and some of the Big Five traits are visible in the face. The Dark Triad consist of machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. Machiavellianism has strong negative correlations on agreeableness and conscientiousness. Narcissism has strong positive correlation in extroversion and openness, and low on agreeableness. Psychopathy has strong positive correlation in extroversion and openness, and low on conscientiousness, neuroticism and agreeableness. It can be deduced that machiavellism correlates to xxTP types, narcissism on ENTx types and psychopathy has strongest correlation to ENTP. And this is indeed the case. ENTP scores highest both on “primary psychopathy” (= lacking in empathy, presenting antisocial tendencies and lacking in conscience) and on “secondary psychopathy” (= irresponsible behaviour, lack of respect on laws, authorities and ethics and disregard of decency). I call it as the “sleazeball” scale If we reduce the score on psychopathy as the intrinsic value of the vector from origo to the score point and the longer the distance to origo the more likely to belong in dark triad, ESTP scores second highest with INTP third. Both have two common properties (TP on Machiavellianism and Narcissism, and ESTP has the E on Narcissism. ESTP is your common bully and fraudster while ENTP is your pure-bred psychopath and chaotic crackpot. There is a trend: the less common properties with ENTP, the All T types score higher on primary psychopathy than F types, while the P types (with exception of ESFP) score higher on the sleazeball scale than any of the J types.

[Which two personality types are the hardest to manipulate?](https://www.quora.com/Which-two-personality-types-are-the-hardest-to-manipulate)

I think all types are manipulable. It’s just a matter of where their weaknesses are.

The ESFs are manipulated by social pressure.

The ISFs are manipulated by guilt.

The ENFs are manipulated by withholding love.

The ENTs are manipulated by roadblocking them.

The INFs are manipulated by trust.

The INTs are manipulated by reverse psychology.

The ESTs are manipulated by temptation.

The ISTs are manipulated by frustration.

And so on. Everyone has a pressure point. All you have to do is find it and squeeze.

  

[Which MBTI types have the most interesting personalities? Why?](https://www.quora.com/Which-MBTI-types-have-the-most-interesting-personalities-Why?no_redirect=1)

“The introverted intuitive lives the most interesting life, but the most difficult. For he sees most uncommon things! But he can not speak of it, unless he is a fool. He would give up his game, and no one would understand.”

  
  

ESTP: “Jesus Christ! Why can’t she/he stop telling me the same things over and over again and be so dramatic? There are so much more important things to talk about then that crap.”

ESFP: “You think you are smarter than everyone else? I can smell that you are faking it, try again next time babe”.

ESFJ: “If you cannot keep a promise, then you cannot keep me”.

ESTJ: “Stop doing whatever you want! We need a plan! You just need to follow my way of doing this”.

ENTP: “If you come to me to talk about irrelevant topics and cannot find a good reason to back your idea, then you can kiss me goodbye”.

ENFP: “Stop telling me what to do. I am the boss of me. There is so much that can be done, and I want to do all of it!”.

ENFJ: “Stop ignoring the fact that there is chaos. We need to find a way to fix this problem and make everyone happy”.

ENTJ: “Can. You. Seriously. Do. Something. Useful?”.

ISTP: “Can you just get to the point?”. *does an eye roll*

ISFP: “You think that money can buy me? You can only buy me with your love”.

ISFJ: “I am quiet because I want to listen to you and find a way to help you. Please do not judge me yet”.

ISTJ: “I will smile when I feel like it. You did not make me smile.”.

INTP: “You need to prepare a Gatling gun of evidences before you try to argue with me”. *takes out encyclopedia to prepare for war*

INFP: “Woah… Please take it slow on me. Let's set a nice atmosphere between us, just like it was in that romcom I watched last weekend”.

INFJ: “I know your motives, you cannot fool me. I know what you want”.

INTJ:

“Dang it… Talking to you finished all my social quota”.

*proceeds to isolate themselves the whole day*

  
  
  

INTJ - plans within schemes within plans - you are in a simulation and it is theirs

ENTJ - look like they take everything personally but secretly couldn’t give a shit (they just like a good fight)

ENFP - probably some appalling impulse purchase they just made that they are trying to hide from you

INTP - honestly, leave it secret, it’s probably very boring when explained in extreme detail

ENTP - that they managed to keep a secret for 10 minutes without mouth vomiting it because they are so proud of themselves… oops, secret gone - they are probably manipulating you too

INFP - wow, do they have anything that isn’t secret? you probably offended them accidentally a year ago and they are still punishing you mildly

ISFJ - still keeping a secret someone asked them to 20 years ago because they have no idea of the consequences

ESFJ - hiding all sorts of socially embarrassing information about others

ENFJ - they think some of their schemes and opinions are secret… but they are extremely transparent.. they’ll probably get what they want anyway

INFJ - they harbour lots of secret guilt about everything they have ever done, beyond that your access to information is based on your level of “friendship clearance”

ISTJ - they once broke subrule 15f by leaving a full stop off the end of a sentence, they still secretly feel like a rebel

ESTJ - probably hiding some tax evasion that they are convinced they were completely justified in doing

ESTP - that 80% of what they have told you is bull crap and they don’t intend to actually keep most of the promises they made

ISTP - information is on a need to know basis, they are probably planning the perfect bank robbery as you speak to them

ISFP - they are secretly having doubts about all the commitments they made and are about to skip out under the pressure

ESFP - that really they are just the guy / girl from next door pretending to be super important

Extroverted sensing VS Extyroverted Intution

Extroverted sensing Notice all details all new things and be attached to real life   my esfp coworker was like great she looked amazing like literally every single day but it's more so that it's um that they are very conscious of what they wear and like the textures and how it feels and so if something is not is going to    Extrovereted Inution Like idea of thing not the thing itself really.  may loose sense they even exist in brain possibilities   she likes the thing she likes the idea of the thing not necessarily the thing and um so they like to look at possibilities of what could be so when they are in a room we they will filter through all the objects in the room and if there is nothing interesting in the room what happens to you i just don't pay attention to anything else around me and i just go to my head   there's something around me and i actually am interested in it then i will still look at it and it i'm going to either talk about it out loud and tell you all the ideas that i have about this object especially if it's something new and i want to know all the things about it and then i want to start thinking about all the things it could be used for that it wasn't necessarily created for however if i'm in a room and i see something that i um or i don't see anything that that interests me then sometimes what i'll do is i will find something very very normal very generic in the room that's not new and not exciting at all that i don't usually care about at all and i will think about either where it came from or where it's going or why it's even here it's like why is this why are these flowers right here why is why did they bite in that table if that table looks like that why do they buy that table that's right huh that's rude it is rude but it's just i won't say it out loud usually i do have some manners but i it's in my head of just like i don't like  are trying to connect things that don't always make the most like the strongest connection so for instance they could find like if they're in a room they might look at like corn like an ear of corn and they automatically jump to like corn mazes and like corn in like the crop circles and now we're into alien land and they're starting to think about the possibilities of aliens because their mind jumped that way and the big thing to notice here with what they are doing like the motivation behind what they are doing is they are connecting a ton of unrelated things like aliens to corn is what they jump to and so like in their mind it's not like they're making that like that clear linking thing it's like corn also now they're thinking about aliens and it's so quick that they don't even necessarily understand that they're doing that and so if somebody asks them what are you thinking about they're kind of really caught off guard because they're like oh man i'm over yes i'm over in alien land like well you can't just say that because it doesn't make any sense and you know that it's not going to make any sense so it's kind of like you have to then backtrack to you either make up something right on the spot which we're also good at doing or you quickly try to backtrack and be like oh what made me think about this and then you're like oh just looking at that ear of corn really that's not exactly the truth but  an expert intuitively more like looking at the possibilities of what could happen so like when they're like funneling through their closet they're like picking together outfits and saying like if i wear this outfit maybe this thing will happen to me later on today if i wear this one maybe this something else will happen           ----------  one difference i could i could potentially see happening is like whereas i'm only noticing that drawer and i'm like oh that'd be so easy i'm probably not noticing the security guard that's right across the way whereas an sa user was probably took in their surroundings first and noticed a security guard whereas like if i was dumb enough to try to steal from that then i would just like totally me like yeah i might be easy to take from it but there's plenty of security around that i just didn't notice at all i         ------------- all the possibilities of what could happen so even though i'm still in the moment and i'm still making sure that the couches are in the right place and i seem like i'm very picky about where everything is going it is not because i care that it's that it looks good necessarily it's that i want it to be able to be used for what i want to be used for in the future  -------------- doesn't like talking he likes doing so he kind of perks up in conversation when it is about actually doing something so like if they're planning like a party or planning an event or if something like funny is going on or interesting then he'll perk up but if people are just kind of talking like how was your day today type of deal he may not be so super interested and so he may kind of like look around the environment and take in that information rather than actively engage because it's not something he's interested in but if it's interested in planning and experience then he wants to do it um extraverted intuition will have a okay time on conversation because how does conversation go for you when you get bored in a conversation when i get born in a conversation i'm still kind of paying attention because i know that i will have to jump in at some point um but usually it's like a blah blah blah blah blah off to the side um and then also i don't necessarily perk up the way that an se would like if they're talking about doing something or something i'm still like oh okay yeah i'm it's but what i will get from the conversation is that i will almost like still be paying attention so if they start talking about something that does happen to interest me in any shape or form i will immediately jump in but i jump in and i'm extremely annoying when i jump back in because i completely take like whatever conversation is happening i do not come back into that conversation i steer it somewhere totally random wherever my head went and and it's not like it's an easy to follow line like we said earlier so it's like i jump back in and i'm like already working out the idea that was in my head and everyone else is like what just happened       Extroverted sensing is also usually associated with um being good at sports like that's just one of the things that's not about they don't have to be good at sports they can like not be good at it but one of the things is they don't mind repetitive motion or they have a tendency to not mind repetitive motion as long as it's an interesting one because they see it as like getting better at the action so like they will like go batting like if they're in baseball they'll go like practice batting like for hours at a time or if their thing is drawing like they will practice drawing and like practice the same thing drawing the same thing over and over again because that is like the routine that is going to help them in practical reality and it's going to make their reality actually easier and so they will stick to those kind of things     maybe you're a little older and you've really tapped into your inferior function even then you're still not ever going to be like the best routine but maybe you're a little bit better than what we're about to describe any does not organically stick to a routine well at all whatsoever and even repetitive motions or actions like an essies or doesn't it just it doesn't happen if i had to repeat anything at all if any users have to repeat anything at all it will drive them crazy like there has to be some there has to be some game you can create from it or something new that can happen from it or um once in a while like justine jesse and i talked about this a few weeks ago like if i'm on the computer and i'm just like my mind is just going numb and i'm able to sit there and like do data entry or something um for like that two hours then sometimes that feels good because it's almost like like a little vacation from any but it is not something that i can do every day in fact i probably couldn't even do that the very next day like i can't do the same thing two days in a row it's incredibly hard to exist this way and it is one thing that as any user i dislike about myself  ---  saying she called it a box it's limiting her so like any does not want factual limitations nope so that's why when any users are kind of like brainstorming daydreaming out loud if you put a pin in their idea and you're like that's not practical and i've done this stir so many times that's not practical because this this and this and this they're gonna get upset with you because you are limiting their ideas and plus something like i've said before annie just likes to play with ideas it doesn't matter if they're actually ever going to do it don't squash on what they're talking about on their ideas or anything until they actually start to like put in the work to make that happen     like my dad works for himself like he has his own like little he has his own company he makes all his choices and he has four years he does not want anybody else to make those choices for him but these are like in the concrete physical world any doesn't like being stuck in things where they don't have those choices either but the biggest problem for them is if they can't ex if they are they lose the ability to dream and if they're caught in a routine what i think typically happens is they can't if they can't dream about possibilities anymore because their world has to become so real because of that routine that's when they feel really stuck that's because the world all of a sudden gets like almost too small yeah like it's like the world in front of you is no longer this like whole wide world with all these possibilities all these places to see people to me ideas to ponder books to read like all these different things like you it feels like everything just like the walls caved in around you is honestly what that feels like so so many times if you're an enemy user and you're maybe working like an eight to five office job or you're working like or you're just stuck in a life where you where you just feel like you are kind of like trapped i feel you and it's it sucks like it really really really sucks to be in that position so i can't imagine    she spends so much time talking about it it's not going to talk about is researching because i'm i'm so scared that i'm gonna miss out on something better so like i'll sit there and i will like research something like okay that's a cool idea so then i'll leave it up on like my computer as like a tab and then i'll open up a new tab and then i'll start reach so i still have that one so if i would just decide on that one if i would just make a decision and put myself in the damn box and just decide on it see the second two square jar we're getting a swear jar down here just for amanda in the little graphics swear jar because amanda can't use proper language at all  a list because during the week i'm always thinking of these things because i want to get out of my environment so i'm always thinking of other things i would rather be doing and so now i have a list on my phone of all of the things that i want to do if it's just me and my husband all the things that i want to do if it's me or my kids so then i tell myself you are not allowed to research anymore you just choose one of those things that's on your short little list and make it happen she's getting better i'm getting better i i but you have to actively try that's the point is that there's there this is not a natural thing it is natural for you as an ending user to like explore explore explore and want all the new stuff and also always search for the best of the new so the difference between that and my father is my dad no that would never happen when my dad wants to do something fun he does something fun and if he's researching you bet your person booty nope you bet yourself that he's actually going to go and do it

just go out with me on friday and be like oh yeah sure because time's not real still like cares right now yeah um but for her like she will actually do them so she spends so much more time like partying and like having actual fun in physical environments where like intuitives are more likely to talk about it and never go do anything i will always tell someone yeah sure let's let's meet up yeah she says it all the time all the time all the time but then i won't i won't actually unless it unless there's like a different drive like a different function that's driving it which often there is so i will say like i do do things don't just think that like sit on my my butt all day and i'm just like not doing anything i do do things but they have to fall in line with my other functions and that's where i get my motivation from and he's the one that like that's my function that dreams up all these ideas but then it has to be filtered through something else for me to actually have to get it done

so annie(Ne) is grounded to reality with s i and s-e is grounded to reality with ni

Ne uses Si whearas Se uses Ni

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

EXTROVERTED VS INTROVERTED THINKING (I am Te)

extroverted thinking does so when she's looking at a budget

she is trying to focus on the big picture part for me i'm picking a part of does this

make sense for me so i'm like looking at all of like the small details where she's looking at big picture

because she's external i'm internal i'm trying to see if it makes sense in my system she's trying to

put out a system onto the world motivations gotta look at them

i have a system when i'm using a thinking process it is my system it is i

own it and it's mine amanda it's external it's out there so also amanda is good at

so you misused a word i found it your entire argument is invalid now because you had one issue and like because

that's what ti does it like introverted thinking it literally finds the weak spots in the

arguments and it picks it all apart and it shows you like it lays it out of why all these things are wrong

and a lot of times that can look really emotional because introverted thinking is an internal process so for me like

i get really really heated really fast when i'm arguing or picking apart an idea um it can also

look a little defensive to someone else who's arguing them because you're like you're focusing on the one part but

that's not the reason that i'm arguing we had this discussion because oh my god yeah like you're

focused on the one tiny aspect that's not even what i'm arguing but you focus on the one thing i said wrong even though my idea is

actually right right so when she's arguing she's looking at the the idea the whole big picture what this

actually means so if you're gonna pick apart something that i said to me that is the

most annoying thing that someone could possibly do because it's like that's not the

reason that i'm pushing this that's not the reason i'm arguing it i am looking all around me for this and i am looking

at what this is going to do in the future like i'm future pacing as well so i

can easily come up with like a five to ten year plan and so if someone wants to pick apart details in that and like

that's ridiculous and a waste of time because i'm talking about five years not every detail is gonna be not every

detail is gonna be perfect it's not gonna be perfect for ti if they had a five year plan oh my god that thing would be flawless

 it's kind of like where fi will put themselves in the shoes of somebody to

and then look at how they would feel about it introverted thinking puts themselves in the idea like and then they try to see

if the idea will work and so sometimes like when i'm typing someone i can recognize a ti so fast

so fast because it i feel like it's like attacking me sometimes if they're ti dominant so istp estp intp entp if

like it's almost like the first thing i see when they come at me is because it's like so strong but it's just because they want

to see an idea and they want to put themselves in the idea versus a te who also comes at me strong

typically but what are they usually like what are the te users in our lives like they're again

big picture i feel like i'm just constantly saying that but that's what they are so they'll they'll give you these ideas or these

thoughts or these plans or anything like that and they'll be like yeah this is like in game this is this is where i'm ending up

Te is efficiency focus and will like to search up different recipoie for cooking same thing to phase out the best method

Ti wants to do things in their own way, they are attached to theiur method and system.

 i typically don't wear darker colors you know what so much

makes sense right now oh yeah there's a big difference so i try i try

to stay very seasonal and it it just helps me like because again big picture that's not

those those are details but to me the bigger picture the reason i'm doing this is because

of a season in my life and so that's really important to me

If you're Thinking user there is a chance you may not spend time in fight cause you consider it waste you've better things to do.

Ti may enforce their thinking kind of same on multiple child like look here kid- if you dont do this this this this will happen

whearas Te is more focus on child not on wehat he has to do but what is suited for that individual child

if you're a thinker type why are you fighting about like you have too much to do and

if you don't you should so go find something that was t this is te for sure this is te child

this is a bratty ate child being like get off your butt and go find something to do something that's worthwhile

stop fighting thinking yes fighting is not worthwhile i mean it can be kind of fun though it can be fun that's all that's all good

you can you can come argue with me yes yeah i pick a fight with her because i won't i literally fight all of you she

will try and i will literally be like i will she'll say something and i will

literally just like completely ignore it and move on to a different subject i don't even realize that she's

trying to pick a fight until like a minute later and i'm like oh yeah

  

 te is on axis with fi

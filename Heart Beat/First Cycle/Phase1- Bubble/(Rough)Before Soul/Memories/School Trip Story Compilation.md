Manali

It was a tale of class 3 or class 4. It was the first trip and worst trip of my life, so obviously I was excited beyond words. I wanted to go there together with my best friend with whom i have been friends till i was 1-2yrs old. But he wanted to go with a group of some of his other friends. ( I was starting to understand that he find being those people more fun than me which really made me feel jealous and possessive. But all of that group of kids were  group who used to bring expensive & stylish pens, chocolates and things,  he would like spending time with a gorup more.


I felt betrayed and it was a little saddening cuz you know i have grown with him so i wanted to spend/share the first time memory of going on a trip with him but i cant do anything. Before this our friends who were in higher class used to tell us about their trips and we thought it was so amazing and cool. We heard that kids in 10/12 used to go for multiple days trip and i wanted to grow up so bad.

After asked my other friend who used to sit next me, he too was excited, so we made our plan together, snacks, what we will find each other on day of trip because we used to come to school from different bus, blah blah.

I woke up early because I couldn't sleep due to excitement.

I reached school

He used to come in a van and he used to arrive in school after me. I was excited and energized. I talked with some of my classfriends.

Tiooo lazy to type (i asked around multiple people and my classmate about which bus/van he came, anyone they knew who come from his van. Time pass pass. I was desperate (-ve thoughts were starting to creep in my mind but in that i had really big faith in God. I used to believe that some supernatural force exist and he will help me i do good.

I used to think i wish for something not to happen then it will happens so i saying to myself that he will not come.

 I just prayed to god but it looks like god had other plans from me. After  endless query from here there. Finally one person told me his van came already but he wasn't there my heart broke.

 and what do you think i realised.

That friend of mine didn't come. 

It was just the beginning of the day.

All plans were shattered now and I realised that I will have to go on the trip alone.

I sat somewhere in bus and some other starger kid sitting on other side.

I was disheartened obviously but i was trying to keep myself optimistic I tried shifted my attention outside of the window, feel the wind and tried to enjoy the scenic view but I was disappointed and slept soon I guess sleeping helped me refresh my mood.

When i woke up. I was fairly in a positive mood. I ate some of the snack i bought (Me and my other friend planned how the two of us will distrubute who brings what, but now he was not there so i get to eat my snacks alone). I odnt have special memory after that but soon we arrived

Soon we arrived at the water park.

I don't remember how it looked but it was the first time in my life that i saw a swimming pool. Before that I had only watched it in TV ads.

It was really amazing and all my sadness from the morning really went away because of the newness.

After the teacher told us the instructions they allowed us to go wherever we wanted to.

There were 4-5 pools where the biggest one was reserved  for adults only.

In the pool I went, a water wave would come in the time intervals but after ‘I don't know’ minutes of initial excitement, I got bored because you know there is so much fun I can have alone.

I looked around and I saw there was a slide wala pool and there were 3 slides in it.

One came straight down in the middle and the other two were spiralling.

They looked big from the ground, which scared me but as you know, I was getting bored and I paid money for the trip, so I am going to enjoy it to the fullest.

Actually there was an age limit board sign near the place where you enter the slide but i didn't notice it and  because i was among the tallest in my class so the people who were shielding the slide from little kids did not consider me an anomaly too.

Also that pool had a special quality which at that time I was not aware of - The pool gets deeper as you go ahead, towards the area where the slides end where it was deepest.

Fufufu

There was big line for the slide and after few minutes was walking slowly and big line my chance was about to come 

 It was a closed area when i was in line so i coulndt take a peek down but now the view from the top of slides was visible and i was scared.

I initially knew that this slide was tall but when i got to the top it was way higher than I expected.

I wanted to run away, really badly, but i have been shy, hesitant to talk to stranger, much less bring attention to myself by standing out and saying i want to go back when there was big line of kids waiting for their turn behind me.

I knew i am fucked (mere laag gaye hain), but i saw  the kid in front of me going there effortlessly.

They can do it, and so can I, I tried to say to myself but I was still scared.

When i sat on slide, someone gave me a slight push and i accelerated so fast in few seconds before i plunged into water which was really deep and I started to drown. 

IT WAS SWIMMING POOL WHOSE DEPTH InCRease the more you to in and i don't realized that.

 I wasnt resisting for saving my life.

My eyes were open i can see blue and lights and it was kind of pretty.

I knew i was dying and just thought of dying, i tried to move my body but strength wasn't enough for me to move,

I was sure i am going to die. Suddenly thought of mom dad,

No not for saving me.

They sent for trip for enjoyment what will they think if i die.

My body gathered more strength and force and my arms and body was flapping little now, in begging my strength was enough to move and feel & understand my movement , but now there was more vigor but my flailing around doens't helped me in ascending 

I flapped my arms with full strength to do something but nothing was happening and I was drowning more. I thought I was going to die

I was thinking what my mother weather would.think.if die.

I again tried really hard to move hand kick, my eyes were open below the pool 

 but then suddenly i was lifted up

 ek lifeguard bhiya saved me by grabbing me by arms and pulling my whole body out with only just my arms.

It was just an indescribable feeling. My whole body was shaking very badly and i just can't describe that dreadful feeling, my body was just petrified

He dropped to a place outside of the pool and he went back. I didn't get to see the face of the person who saved me

 because i was so occupied with what just happened, i couldn't comprehend anything, my body was just petrified.

but my body wouldn't stop shaking, I calmed down after little time.

I realize that if i can't just remain standing her because only 30-40 min have passed, that slide was the first thing i did, i will stand out people will notice me  

When i went near the swimming pool in which i just drowned then i just didn't had the courage, i also realized From seeing the floating kids that it was pool which becomes more deeper as you go inside, i didn't noticed it earlier. Maybe i was in too much rosy state to see things clearly but it got broken .

so i went to the shallower pool for kids next to the pool i almost drowned in, for the even little kids And when i just got close and tried to dop my leg, my body just started shivering so badly, MY BODY WAS TRAUMTISED BUT SPIRIT WAS NOT and it wasn't like i went to that water with fear in my mind, but it was an reflex action type of response maybe due to being traumatize, i get away and think this is my first trip i am supposed to enjoy myself so finally i gather some courage .

On the edge of that smallest and shallowest swimming pool i look for spot with minimum population density , and i just sit there and dip my feet to the bare minimum. Even in just dipping my feet, i was shivering, my body was traumtised by water but i atleast dipped my feet regardless.

I am so proud of myself that i didn't let trauma of body stop me 

 but it was not overwhelming.

 I waited for hours so that we will leave this place.

and as around that time after few hour our school staffs began to arrange for unch for 3-4 miutes before  got the chance to eat. After lunch a lot of time was still left.

which i had to sand in long line and wait for.

THEN ON THE WAY BACK HOME.

I HAD BUNCH OF SNACKS LEFT BECAUSE THE TWO OF US DECIDED TO BRING HALF HALF STUFF. ( I WILL BRING A, B, C THING FOR TWO FO US, YOU CAN GET X, Y, Z for two of us). FOR VARIETY. BUT I WAS I DON”T WHAT I WAS EATING MAYBE IT WAS KRUKURE BUT AFTER EATING FEW PACKET I GOT FED UP WITH IT, BUT I WANTED TO FINISH EVERYTHING SO I STILL ATE IT.

When i finally reached home.

My mom started to pester me by asking me how was the day? WHat did you see? WHat did you buy with the money? (I dont remember questions exactly) But you know i didn’t wanted to talk about all that so i remember i was acting that i am feeling super sleepy and just tried to get away from there so i can just lie on my bed. I didn’t wanted mom to know and somewhere unconsciously that kid knew that speaking less is the best option Id din't wanted ti talk to my mom cuz i felt like i will cry and when you feel like crying and you talk you will definitely start to cry, but i have to talk even if it’s just little so by acting sleepy or as if i am thinking something, they will misinterpret the information and i will be safe. 

, when IF she ask about my friends waht will i say> I  felt so shameful, isn't whoe point of school trip t oenjoy with friends and stufff. I FELT TO ASHAMED FOR IT. But becoz of near-death experience, the DREAD OF DEATH IT WAS FAR MORE OVERPOWERING. I WAS MORE SCANRED OF THAT. I WANTED TO BE STRONG IN FRONT OF MY MOM

i lied on bed. My boy was shivering and feeling of almost facing a near death experience was just unbearable. I didn't understand what just happened today and everything was so confusing and i just couldn't understand what I should do. 

IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED THE QUESTION OF DEATH. What would have happened if i died.

I cried that night to sleep and did for a few days before I got used to it.

BUT AS CHILD I WAS OPTIMISTIC KID. SO IT REALLY HELPED.

I WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR NOT DYING but WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I DIED SCARED ME. and thanks to death being my ENEMY. I didn’t think about MY FIRST TRIP WAS A RUIN. 

I think one of the reasons i loved 5th classs in stanfird so muich cause i felt i had deeper friendship and more attention

Class 4th trip was to akshardam and i dont have special memory of it but i remember i was alone there too

 Kunal and I were teasing ‘harsh’ that ‘harsh’ means ‘khushi’ and ‘khushi’ means ‘harsh’ on class 5th trip it was really fun.

Our school on the previous year has organised a trip out of station to nanital (maybe) (i don't remeber exactly) and it took so much convincing with my parents to make them give permission for me to go. However ayush pulled back from going to trip at last moment and if ayush wasn't going to nanital then i had no reason of going there either cause i wanted to have the experience to go out with your friends, sleep in common room and have chat and play all night. A place far away from my home. I cared less about scenery or even food. And if ayush wasn't going then isn't it all pointless. Apparently he was going with his mother to nanital on trip in the same time range so he would only be seeing the same scenery eutherway. I even went to his mom to try to convince her that ease send her with us but she said that their family had plans of going out of station and they will not coming for whatever time and that time was 4-5 days ahead of time we will return back from trip so ayush will not have a home to return to. I remeber saying that ayush can stay at home. And just thought my friend staying over my house made me really happy. I always wished that ayush was my brother so that we could play computer games together and watch movies till late at night.

But in the end he didn't go So i also pulled back from going.

One more of my friend daksh was going too but i didn't have much interest in going with him.

Daksh saw me as one of the closest friend in his life at that time, he would come and talk to me about pubg and technology and stuff. We had similar interests. He was good close friend but for some reason i didn't enjoy his company that much i felt he was boring and i used to really feel guilty and bsd about it cause i used to feel that i am very boring person who will enjoy spending time with me. A few times my friends have kicked me out of circle for small time (maybe like sitting arrangement in class that we have limited seats so not everyone in circle can actually sit here so one has to go away, things like that). Rhey made me feel like a filler character

During those time daksh and harsh were the friends i know can fall back to but i will soon return to my old circle when the opportunity present itself.

In a way i was treating daksh the same way they were treating me. 

What's the difference between me and them if i am doing this to daksh. I really felt guilty about it. 

 I am valueable part in his life so i should be valuing him the same. 

He didn't really seem to care or be sensitive/perceptive enough to notice or care maybe see through my mind or maybe i was oversensitive due to my fear of abandonment either way i remeber trying many times that i will sit with daksh and not with that circle that didn't valued me that much. i will always feel conflicted should i go back to my old friend circle or stay with daksh when they will ask me to come over for lunch.

I stayed with daksh for i guess long time but after long i again began to sit with them.

When in class8 when heard news that we are going to Manali. I was so happy but sad cause the range if time of my trip and range of time when we are supposed to go to bua's home were colliding.

This time i didn't wanted to waste chance

I begged my mom so much. I promised i will do xyz thing in study please let me and after so much begging mom agreed m

She said you rarely ask of anything so its okay .

I was happy and i just couldn't believe i really will be going.

I told my friends and even called one of their mom and requested her to send their kids but they didnt agree.

Days passes and the day was getting closer but i wasnt feeling as if we really will be going on a trip. It was a slight doubt cause everything in school was going so normally and actually my intuition was correct and then an announcement came that trip has been delayed And the time to which it was delayed was the same time my father has booked ticket for bus home second time.

I told my parents and try to push it but this time i felt shameful for making request cause booking ticket and cancelling it wastes money and it made me feel bad.

When i told my friends inwont be going. Those who were not going earlier were happy seeing that. And they just didn't have much to say.

I think somya asked me wheter i got my money back and i was too much of a pussy to go out of class and fee hget my money myself. I told i will talk to teacher when the come to class or something like that i will take it later and she just dragged me with her to teachers office

All the way i was like 

'oh no, it fine you don't have to worry about it.'

 and began to complain fatty-tall-Hindi teacher saying it's schools fault for doing this they should prepone and see torln school. School just preponed on the last moment without any warning. Seeing her getting angry for my behalf made me so happy but i was screaming in my head 

And it was first seeing someone upset on my behalf and moreover that person is the one who i ahd crush for so long.

She even went as far as to say that she will not go if they don't prepone and i was so so moved happy seeing her stand for me but insidey head all that was going was

'no no no no. what's happening? i don't understand. 

There is no need to go that far. It's okay just stop. But after seeing her in enraged mode i didn't have courage to say that to her face' i 

Now i got my money back and then again next time sir Hindi-fatty-tall entered the room she again created a ruckus and said this time noone in class will go if they don't prepone. 

Oh god i was so embarassed and so so moved. I am sure no one other then her in class will say that but she was just saying in the behalf of other just by herself without even asking them if they wanted that or not.

And i was llittle embarassed cause i became center of attention but at the same time moved 

But when the argument ended between her and teacher. 

I was so os so so so touched seeing her go this  so far i didn't wanted to wine or cry about it

I think i said it's okay you should go and the argument finally ended.

She started to cry and i was much shocked.

Shock soon turned into just feeling  like someone has seen through me and understand my suffering and i think her tears and crying were like healing spell. 

Tiny shards of pain and sadness that were left  just disappeared. The feeling of someone acknowledging and understanding my pain, i can't even put into words how good i felt. 

But That was absolutely the happiest and the memory I hold most fondly onto.

And it was the first time someone cried for my sake. It's felt so nice.

It was really the most beautiful moment of life. Just remembering it even after so long  still tingles my heart. 

Maybe that was the purest of joy. 

I felt like  i had strength to bear all the suffering of the world without even flinching.

All my disappointment just disappeared as if it never existed n the first place.  

A lot of my friends were going to trip but then going didn't made jealous or made me feel like i am missing out on something. Those experiences felt so insignificant compare to The experience of The pure joy, the beauty i have witnessed/feel, the two can never ever even hope to compare to something so small. Both are just on different plane. its scary that i could have gone through my whole life without realising such happiness can even be felt.

Even now just from writting about it, i get so much strength and courage. I wanted to 

redit this story so i can get more strength i face the future.

Our school kids did bezaati of our school in trip to ‘land of mahabharat’. There was a large bhul bhulaiya whcih was dark, our school kids were shouting screaming saying names of teachers, abusing. Our school did a huge hungama, even the owner of place were angry at us. Our Vice principal sir got angry and said he will never our school to trip ever again. He asked us to be learn from kids of other school who too was there and were looking at us ki ‘yee konse aajib zahil pranhi’.

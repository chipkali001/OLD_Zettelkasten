The NFJ’s are usually reading fantasy or good historical fiction books or maybe books written by well known historical figures on world peace or something similar to that.
ESTP - doesn’t read. Reading is for losers. If they do touch something that is considered reading material, Sports Illustrated or Gym magazines.
ISTP - a mechanic/engineering handbook or magazine. Whether it’s on boats, cars, rockets or aircrafts: they’re reading it and most likely in that profession of what they’re reading.
ESTJ and ISTJ - the rulebook.
INTJ and INTP - philosophical books about the universe, science or math textbooks and I’ve seen a few INTPs reading Stephen King and an INTJ reading Mein Kampf for fun/research.
ENTJ - economics or leadership books. Luxury travel magazines are also popular for them.
ENTP - the for dummy books or satires.
ESFP and ISFP - I’ve never really seen these types read because they’re always busy.
ISFJ - the Bible or something spiritual. All of the ISFJs I’ve met are heavily religious.

NFP’s - fantasy books or romance novels. Nature books are also a big hit.

# DETECTION CLASS
-   INFJ: when the perfect student forgets the homework and the teacher kicks him/her outta the class :/ and of course they leave the class with an unexpected DOOR SLAM!
-   ENFJ: the student who calmly talks and persuades the teacher why him/her is wrong. While tries to play cool And fights the growing anger and sadness inside.
-   INFP: the polite invisible student who's writing a poem or a diary rapidly but the tensions in the class has shattered his/her heart. so they just stare at their papers and try to ignore the sadness and stress.
-   ENFP: the student who feels bad for the INFJ and wants to defend him/her but hey look! there's a bird outside the window! * passionately talks about how admirable the bird is and tries to pet it*
-   INTJ: the student who doesn't give a damn and continues to read his/her book which is more beneficial than the class.
-   ENTJ: the “who cares" student who has no time for dramas. There are many goals to be achieved so just starts reviewing his/her notes.
-   INTP: didn't even recognise the fuss because is too busy with a bunch of brilliant ideas in his/her mind which are more intresting than this whole class
-   ENTP: doesn't get the teacher but pretends to support him/her just to see where the debate goes, then suddenly changes his/her opinion to make it more challenging.
-   ISFJ: feels sorry about the INFJ. It's sad, but it's the rule. The teacher could be kinder though :( *nodds to support the ENFJ*
-   ESFJ: the student who is talking with his/her friend about the situation. They're also volunteers to go and talk to the INFJ to come back. (Actually they just will go and tell the INFJ never come back again cause the teacher is absolutely wrong.) Meanwhile *stares at the teacher in a bad way*
-   ISTJ: doesn't care about it. Rules are the rules and should be obeyed. Meanwhile writes next sessions homework. but gosh somebody stop the ENFP talking about that bird *face palm*

[What is the dark secret of each personality type?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dark-secret-of-each-personality-type)

INFP - Childlike and cute until you wrong them and then you will see them wise up and mature within a matter of seconds.

INTJ - Revels in the idea that everyone thinks highly of them for their intelligence and their cold, rational mind but secretly craves that one person with whom they can have a real emotional connection with.

ISTP - Too much suppressed emotion which usually comes out in the most freakiest of sexual acts with their partner.

ENFP - Extremely friendly but will leave you as soon as you stop providing them “mental stimulation”.

ISFP - Would rather get bullied by society than lose out on their “unique” identity.

ESFJ - Care so much about their public appearance that they’d never uphold a controversial belief and wouldn’t think twice to cut off someone from their lives with an infamous identity.

ENFJ - Acts caring and noble but only does it to feed their own narcissistic impressions of themselves.

ISFJ - They hold grudges for their whole life.

INTP - They have vast expanses of knowledge on their interests stored in their head but more often than not they just remain collecting dust in their heads and is never applied in real life situations.

ENTJ - Constantly afraid of being in a situation where they can’t sweet-talk/negotiate their way out.

ESTP - They are the most likely to die young or to take unnecessary risks just to spice up their life.

ISTJ - Wishes they could just say “f*ck it” to their 9 to 5 drawl but can’t because too many people depend on them.

ENTP - The larger or more vehement a response they can get from others for their far-fetched ideas and debates, the more accomplished they feel.

ESTJ - Secretly thinks that everyone around them is an incompetent monkey that was birthed with the sole purpose of annoying them.

ESFP - Too self-absorbed to the point where they’d even publicly humiliate themselves to garner even a shred of attention from others.

INFJ - Can mentally cripple anybody that they know well…if they wanted to that is.

(More chaos, more variables, more stuff at same time, **More big brain you can potray yourself to be**)
 *yup more stuff to memz but smarter you appear*
1. Not look, hit but stand still
2. Continue close eyes, 
3. Sir ka Dil aaise nhi bherga bezzati krke maarna chahte hain
4.  head angled little down to reduce moment of how much head moves and how he can strike. Told- piche see bol rhe thee
5. 
6. When look in his eyes. I realise he have an high image of me. 
7. And it clicked shubhankar went not me even though I was near. Also his voice tone and asking me gently 
8. Difficult to explain but fr his eyes look I can tell he doesn't want to hit and me. It was sort of intuition 
9.  Further inturoon support Tome of voice he asked me to look at him, shubhankar 
10. Goal- sir beat all (tell mom) + Change narrative to sir beating all involved (so shubhankar won't tell prpbably)
11. And also now 
12. Sharmana seen as hiding something and usually it triggers imagination of other and they start to guess "oh yee hain"
13. Now now sir wasn't in playful mode, want direct answer don't take my saying sir not wanting to hit me too serious
14. Now when I am talking of involinvg all (including me) problem wasn't that shubhankar and kartikey will coliate and I loose **credibility** in front of sir. I can easily deal by very small things (change seat,please tell them not to come near, maintain credibility)







Mom don’t wanna call
Spread so won’t call, if 5-6 people there would be like mmmm?
**Now Kartikey has shown his vengeance thirst so i will pour it on him.**
Normally i willn’t dump it, but you have announced 



When kartkey was explaining my mind was**divided in big problem**
*NO
Tell this big problem when Sir ask you tell what joke was and you pretend to be shy to craft lies* 


SEE
it’s has lot of angles so tag with me.
1) we both need to get beatup. Why
2) kartikey shubhankar team up. Sir had high regard for me and i’ll lose it along with trust and all blame on me
3) Actually that wasn’t the problem - problem is that if i am in that **situation** 
4) ~~my only option will be to betray Shubhankar first~~ (doesn’t make answer look orignal)
4) I’ll have two choices in case they team up
	1) In front of them, when they are about to go to sir. Tell him please change my seat, they’ll not let me sit in peace
	2) Unreliable - i make fun of them so prospect of telling it to sir WILL HURT THEIR PRIDE. You were saying “You can read my mind” “You understand all my tricks”
5) In both i will have to betray shubhankar too who i considered to be my friend & was good person. **it was against my values that i act in deceptive ways against him**
6) But my mind was telling me -“Why did whole problem started?” “Sir put **blame** for their IRRESPONSIBILITY on me” 
~~“I was blamed as mastermind” “blame wasn’t evenly distibuted”~~ (no make yourself seem like you were the boss and strongest - & you ain’t taking responsibility and it’s all excuse saying - it’s their own fault )

Real - Shubhankar my friend


MY memory is weak, so i can just SPECULATE only
TELL THIS AFTER you have told above story - when they have more interest in CHARACTERS.
AUNTIYO wali baatein MERE SAATH MAAT KRON
Before i FELT & THOUGHT - it was more of an Saale, school walein aaisen hin hain
There he did - just bezzati, he ogthg urt that person he considered his BEST FRIEND is talking of him likme that. 
Tell tale of emoting for kartikey - wanted to make clear to niot attach my name with these. 
Maybe some talk will happen this will get resolved

Shubhankar BEATEN thought - ==What will happen when sir learned==, 
<<<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">==<< At this moment tell of (1)Alok-Sir >>==
</mark>>> 
He was now twiching at ground - (Make sure flow is like this - you tell alok sir one, before YOU FINISH shubhankar getting beaten)
I am laughing - laughing , trying to bite on my hand to stop my laugh don't stop.
Tried composing self.
.
.

REALISE Sir value - fire spread - KARTIKEY & DEVANSH.
Why Kartikey -
<<<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">==At this moment (2)Kartikey-tum chalaki, samjhta hun==</mark>>>



**Now i just passed it off by him saying mind-reading**
Kartikey perceptive and HIGHETEND due to him BEING so PARANOID - of me having an **SECOND-INTENTION** & he somehow through that reached through self-conclusion he can now read my mind

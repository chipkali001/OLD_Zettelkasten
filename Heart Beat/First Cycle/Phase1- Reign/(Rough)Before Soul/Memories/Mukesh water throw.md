It was Saturday and our school has ended my favourite day was Saturday cuz since i don't have to worry about school i can stay up late watch movies, play games and enjoy.

I had for an moment an instict telling me thd is wrong dont do this.

Throwing water on each other before going home and then mukesh incident where mukesh best friend scared me incident brother shared info with mom.

Mukhesh mom and my mom knew each other.

Her mom was really strict she will tell how her mother beats her with belan, broom or whatever is in her hands.



It was a saturday, everyone was boarding buses and children were playing outside. I saw Mukesh and her friends spilling water on each other. Mukesh got under my bus window so I opened my water bottle and emptied it entirely on her.

Everything was ok. I was enjoying my saturday and was happy tomorrow is a sunday. Until I got home and received message from mukesh bestfriend that - i am in trouble.

Apparently mukesh was wet after reaching home. Her mother was angry. Mukesh mother was very very strict she used to beat mukesh with chapal, belaan, etc. And his brother did chugli of everyone who was spilling water on her.

She said something like ki hum sab to bch jayenge tera kya hoga.

I was so scared. I couldnt sleep properly and wasnt able to enjoy the sunday.

In bus I wanted to ask mukesh but she had an bad looking face so i didnt had courage to ask anything.

Lunch break passed and I was happy that nothing happened.

I thought maybe mam and everyone forgot the incident but I was wrong.

A girl from other class came and called name of some girls from a list.

They were all the girls who were throwing water on each other.

My name was not there. I was relieved.

But just in few minute that girl came she called my name + bus number.

Mam was standing there with mukesh.

I slowly slowly walked then i realisead that mam wanted to talk something about bus.

Mukesh and I was same bus.

After talk was over i askedÂ  mukesh about day before yesterday event so she told me that her brother didnt saw me and I got saved.

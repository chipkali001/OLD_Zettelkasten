# Day 11

11 Dec 22.

AFTER NEARLY (2yrs -2.5yrs ) of wasting my time,

I MANAGE TO Rediscover my TWO HAPPINESS, MEANING, FULLFILMENT CENTER.

Imaging a world which is far off the present world it make an zombie apocalypse or maybe fantasy isekai different world

Having someone who will listen to all my bullshit and boring talks too. If I have one person then no-one else is needed. I’ll be happy.

# Day 16 Applied For JeeMains

# Day 17

[Do you have Self Destructive tendencies?Do you have Self Destructive tendencies?](https://youtu.be/uF-d71f22GA)

My fater told me on monday(19dec) i haev to go and give my english practical. THere would be a speaking and listening test. I am freaked out, i may know how to write in english but you can't just make me speaking in nice english on the spot

# Day 18

After few minutes of waking up around 3:50, when i thought about going to school, anxiety terrorized my body. Apparently my father told that you will go to school normally, wearing tracksuit (not school dress) when class teacher come and ask explain him. and everything will go on smoothly.

What the hell does he expect from me. I have been trapped in this room for 3 years, you can't expect that i will just go and sit in school i don't even know name of, nor know anybody, in some weird dress and explain. This might be possible for me, if i didn't felt so much shame over who I am.

It's difficult to hide shame as it as which i have been just collecting and suppressing for so long, when you ask me to do so much, i know i will lose control and start crying.

I can control my will, my will can persevere and remain unaffected but my body and subconsious mind are different matter. I can't fool them and they are linked to external world. they will react to stimuli in external world. And my mental capacity is linked to my body so it will obviously too get impared, even after mind imparement even if my will remain untouched, my body will start panic and cry. How do you expect me to handle that?

In almost 40 days exam of jee main is there, only 15% syllabus complete that too is unrevised.

I SO BADLY WANT TO DIE. EVEN AFTER SHOULDERING SO MANY HEAVY EMOTION AND NOT LETTING MYSELF GET CRUSHED, IF I HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH ISN'T IT BETTER TO DIE. WHY DO I EVEN HAVE TO LIVE LIFE SO PAINFUL.

i am sure in my life i will only collect more -ve experience than +ve (-ve have been there for so long that it's effect has almost beome permanent. My will can't let me just break away from body's reaction&mood), why do i have to live if it's going to be like that, even though i have been trying so hard to be strong.

At this stage, i can't even access anti-depressants that will let me lower down my senstivity of body, jsut will power isn't eillný suffice. And isn't all this just going to add my anxiety and make it even badder.

AND THE WORST THING OF ALL, MY MIND PREDICTED IT 2yrs ago when Father made me join dummy school here, that time too i protested cause i knew, father isn't reliable human being and he isn't even touch with his own emotoions and when on top of that he jsut believe that THE WORLD WORLD JUST WORK SO SMOOTH AND IN REFINE MANNER, from outside you can just say that it just so easy, why can't you do it. Woowoo. I ASKED HIM THAT MAKE ME JOIN A SCHOOL IN KOTA, i believe in coaching authorities in more than him, they are far far more reliable than this sorry exuse of human.

If only i was obrn normal life would have been so much easier, if i have manage to survive and live for so long o nthis high -ve senstivity, then i would be so much more happy and less ashamed. Why can't i just be normal? why i am so grotesque.

I willn't give my practical exam, but then i wont be able to 75% criteria but htat is okay.

I will redo class 12 next year from school in kota.

# Day 19

Went to school for ASL, had stay for whole day (FULL DEPTH OF EVEN IN "2022 Memories""

I would have done a lot better if i was more open and focused in knowing and understanding others.

Instead of worry about impression, i make and being self-absorbed.

I didn't even properly memroized faces or map fo the school

# Day 20

I added parts of David Goggins speech in my DailyRepeatDocs so i can live by those principles

Choose name Vasuki for MC of my novel.

# Day 23

From around 10-10:30 night of Day22 to till 2:11 morning Day23

i was trying to teach monkey and guide him for IITJEE

I am honestly annoyed now because of his behaviour

HE JUST THINK HE KNOWS IT ALL, WHATEVER HE THINKS IS RIGHT IS RIGHT

AND it's okay for believing what he beleive is right, BUT HE WILL NOT EVEN SAY WHAT HE CONSIDER IS RIGHT, he only judges in his mind and don't speak out those judgement , cause in his mind HE KNOWS IT ALL, so what's the point IN EXPLAINING

SINCE YOU KNOW IT ALL.

Monka's life affect mom & dad life so I WILL HAVE TO GUIDE HIM LITTLE.

BUT I THINK I HAVE SAID TO HIM, THE MOST I HAVE TO SAY.

Now i will not give him anymore advice, my part is done/

The only thing if i do will is to check on him and ask how much have done? where are you?

ARound 2:30, i have beeeen feeling this weird feeling inside me and i thought maybe i needed little recreation, if i eat something, relax and watch some good movie while eating then it will disappear BUT I WAS WRONG

It's 4:00 now and i will slep after 10hours but i don't feel like i can last that lonh, I DON'T HAVE ENERGY. FOOD HAS DRAINED OF ENERGY MENTAL .

---

I WILL NOW EAT DIRECTLY TOMMOROW @ 7:30 or 8:00 @NIGHT

---

I NOW REMEBER AS A CHILD I FELT THAT

SLEEPING IN AFTERNOON IS WASTE OF TIME

Do you really not have something in real life that is worthy of waking up and working for

6:32 I am veginning m,aths now past time spent in david googgins video, how to stand for long hours, m0onka talk shit

# Day 24

CREATED MISTAKES DOCS. IN WHICH I WILL WRITE MY MISTAKES

I CHANGED MISTAKES DOCS NAME TO MISTAKES AND BADDASERY

Mistake#1- this will just take 30-45 min (Physics Optics Notes), i will quickl;y do this extra work before getting on track and doing the rest work in order

DON'T BREAK ORDER.

IF YOU WISH TO ADD SOMETHING OR CHANGE COURS WRITE IT IN 3HR DIARY.

EVEN IF IT’S RELATED TO STUDY AND IT WILL DEFINITELY HELP.

DON’T ACT ON IT.

Mistake#2 - WHile watching GODFATHER i got excited.

1st Time - The man pushing the girl against the door and drilling her

2nd Time - when that second man said that that girl had the best ass.

These 2 were triggers and they complement each other sending me into desire to masturbate

- What would my ideal version just act on lust so easily. It wasn’t even something too explicit yet you cave in? Maybe the problem is weakness of your soul and not EVEN BODY!

Why didn't you say something so petty to control you.

I will not GIVE UP MY SELF-RESPECT, my mind will tempt me, my body will tempt me BUT I WON’T CAVE IN.

I don't want to regret wasting my potential

"RECHARGE & FILL RESERVOIRS LUST. (isn’t there something beautiful about bottleing up sadness and then letting it out and that one beautiful moment, it’s so picturesque, so meaningful, so beautiful. )

WHEN THE TIME COMES I WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE ACT MUCH MUCH MORE THAN ANY NORMAL HUMAN.

BUT IF YOU WILL WASTE YOUR ENERGY ON PORN.

THEN YOU WOULD YOU SAY to yourself.

‘Heh it was just earthly, nothing special, disappointed' Do you want that to happen?’

DON’T YOU WANT TO MAKE IT A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE.

Or will it just be another OBJECT TO INDULGE IN?

“PLEASURE, BEING PUPPET OF OTHERS TRYING TO GET THEM TO APPROVE OF ME AS BIG COOL PERSON"

OR “BEAUTY & MEANING”

YES I WILL DO IT FOR THAT FEW GLIMPSES OF BEAUTY.

THAT FEW GLIMPSES OF BEAUTY IS SO MUCH MORE BETTER THAN A HOLLOW LIFE.

WHAT HAS BEEN MEANINGFUL IN MY LIFE AND MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE WERE

That glimpse of beauty and JOY.

ENGAGING IN INDULDGENeCE WAS NEVER EVER BEAUTIFUL!

Remember pavadiya time YOU HAVE RUINED THE BEAUTY OF THE FIRST KeeS. You didn’t felt proud or happy or fullfilled at all, did you?

IT WAS SO SO HOLLOW.

I FEEL SO SHAMEFUL & GUILTY BECAUSE OF THAT

Do you want to life that is so hollow forever.

IF NOT THEN CHOOSE CHANGE TODAY.

FROM TODAY ONWARDS, I WILL BE PROUD PERSON. I WILL NOT DO ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE FEEL SHAMEFUL OR LOWER MY HEAD.

I Don’t control other humans validating and loving me, i don’t control my body sensations, I don’t control the swinging of my mind.

I CONTROL THE CHOICE OF MY MIND NOT TO SURRENDER

#MISTAKE3 - FORGETTING TO KEEP TIMER ON AFTER I WATCHED A YT VIDEO.

If timer had been on, while i was eating, i would have wasted less time, not given in to lust, cuz watching movie is okay but me forgetting my goal and BETRAYING IT ISN’T

#MISTAKE4 - DESIRING AND THINKING ABOUT THING NOT GRASPABLE WITHIN 3 Months.

PLEASE ONCE JEE ADVANCED GET OVER YOU WILL GET LOT OF TIME TO PHILOSOPHIZE, THINK ABOUT YOUR PLACE & POSITION ONCE JEE Advanced get over so leave THINKING ABOUT THOSE THING TO THAT TIME.

And that will be best time cuz YOU WILL THEN BE FILLED WITH SELF-RESPECT, DRIVE ,MOTIVATION hence make better more courageous and strong decision.

CUrrently what you will think or the decision you will make will BE FILLED WITH SHAME AND EMPTINESS. THAT ISN’T VERY GOOD CENTER TO MAKE DECISION.

And even the desire to think these things is only arising cuz you aren’t doing y our DHARMA, therefore you feel ashamed and bad and you want to blame it on these problems.

#BADASSERY1 - SPECIAL GIFT MACARONI, BUT I ONLY EAT WHATEVER WAS GIVEN TO ME IN FIRST SERVING.

#BADASSERY2 - CHUGGED DOWN WATER ALONG WITH PASTA.

SO THAT I GET FILLED BEFORE I EVEN FINISH WHAT’S IN MY PLATE.

#MISTAKE5 - JUDGING THE POEM I WAS HEARING WHILE EATING PASTA.

IT’S OKAY TO CAST YOUR JUDGEMENTS BUT BEFORE THAT FIRST ASK YOURSELF.

WHAT PURPOSE DOES IT SERVE. DO I HAVE SOMEONE WITH WHOM I WILL RANT ABOUT THIS? IF NOT THEN WHY WASTE TIME GRATIFYING YOURSELF?

MY GOAL OF READING POEM = BOARDS ONLY AND I LOST SIGHT OF THAT

I am feeling a very deep loss in energy in my body. Even if i can try to keep sleepiness at bay by ,moving my legs, that feeking of weakness ligners and it just almost consoled me into saying. I should take little rest and sleep.

Again i sat down on chair to read, but i again started feeling sleepy.

MY MIND THIS TIME AGIAN CONVINCED FOR SLEEPING.

My mind said "This fight is futile. It has no meaning nor will serve any purpose. How long will you carry all this heavy things? Just REST and start tommorow with new burst of energy"

I have to fight this fight FOR MYSELF, BY MYSELF cuz there is no gaurentee or reliability that someone magical force will save me. I have TO SAVE MYSELF FROM MYSELF.

30 Days From today 24Dec To 24Jan. I WILL CHANGE AND TRANSFORM MYSELF COMPLETELY IN THIS 1 MONTH. I REFUSE SURRENDER NO MATTER HOW INJURED I AM OR HOW LOW CHANCES OF COMPLETION

# Day 25

I was standing and while writting, a bout of suddden sleepiness drowned me and my kness just buckle in, im ight have almost fallen.

I began to shake my legs while standing to shake off the sleepiness, but after few minute my knees almost gave in again.

I CAN'T BEGAN TO TELL HOW DEMORALIZED THAT MADFE ME FEEL. I just decided few hours ago that i willn't be guided by all this pain, stick to my words, yet my body is giving up on me so soo[n.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLmeEbcouoVOD89Dfgxa5LCV5iKzFVCsyLvgcZKKl98/edit?usp=sharing)

The question of carefree happiness and total satisfaction troubles me.

I don't think ever in my life i had long lasting carefree happiness, or total satifaction EVER

And after i have been beaten down by this depression and so many things, i don't think i will ever be able to feel happy like that.

I wonder what is true happiness? will i ever be happy?

When I rethink two of my most hpapiest phase in life and trace out of source of happiness

5thClass reason for happiness was ,mostly the approval i got from others, i got to feel that i am special. The reason why in class 4 and even earlier i tried to ocmpete and get ahead of ayush in school marks wasn’t just out of competitive instinct but becoz i saw how Ayush was treated differently by others cause he was good at study. I wanted to eb treated like that too. I want to be significant like him too. BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY, MY EFFORTS WIELDED NO RESULT.

SO IN CLASS5th when i suddenly got that approval, i was overjoyed for rest of the year.

BUT next year rudra stole it and the teachers left too.

In class 8th it was love

BUT IS THAT HAPPINESS?

When my source was completely dependent on another person.

I didn’t even made conscious choice. Just my biology compelling me.

It wasn’t my internal core state.

I wasn’t carefree.

I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CAREFREE HAPPINESS IS

AND NOR WILL I EVER GET TO SEE OR TOUCH IT.

Are my above happiness valid or they are just pitiful experiences

AND IF it's never going to happen for waht i am suffering struggling working-hard so desperately for ? I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING +ve i ever got - All my nice good hearted friends, my dreams, my goals, my future, my Faith, Video Games, values, structures that comforted me

None has remained everything has left.

Now whatever leftover i am using for jee prepration is culumnation of all the hardwork, i did since class 5th/6th, yet it feels like i am just going to waste all that

IF MY GOAL IS HAPPINESS

THEN I HAVE FAILED EVER SINCE FROM START,

I guess BEST APPORACH WOULD BE

Accept not being 100% happy anytime, and even temporarl happiness very little control

The only goal i can make is - TO BE SOMEONE I DON'T FEEL ASHAMED IN FRONT OF MYSELF. NOT OTHERS JUST MYSELF. I WANT TO PRODOUD OF MYSELF. EVEN IF I REMAIN SAD, MISERABLE, lONELY.

I want to be proud of myself

I am refilled wit henergy motivation and drive. MY FATHER ASKED ME, if you didn't get good rank in jee will you study from home and kota? I SAID HOME. WOHOO. A great idea has come to me. If i manag eto get 100% God Discipline then after i crack jee advanced. I will obviosuly get good rank but i will ask father that i want to drop 1 year and devlop my hobbies to vuz in college too many things happen and i willnt get time for that.

BUT CONDITION = ME BECOMING GOD otherwise i go to college

I WILL NEED TO DEVELOP THAT GOD LEVEL RESILIENCE

I AM FILLED WITH DRIVE, ENERGY AND MOTIVATION NOW

THE REASON I WAS LACKING DETERMINATION CUZ I WAS FEELING.

That i have been left behind and i will never catch up.

I am loser and pathetic liar

I NOW HAVE CHANCE TO REEDEM MYSELF AND CHANGE THINGS

To become someone i am proud of, no need to cower and hide.

Maybe even grab more happiness, BUT FIRST THING IS SELF-RESPECT, PRIDE IN FRONT OF MIRROR. that is something i control to max

And i will become GOD. Anything less than GOD won't do. Cuz if i become god in 1 drop yr, i can reach 100% potential otherwise there would be homework left for 1st year college

# Day 26

RESOLVE -"FIRST THING IS SELF-RESPECT, PRIDE IN FRONT OF MIRROR. that is something i control to max

And i will become GOD. Anything less than GOD won't do. Cuz if i become god in 1 drop yr, i can reach 100% potential otherwise there would be homework left for 1st and 2nd year college.

I want to show them a GOD, a real GOD, not QUASI-GOD.

I want my first impression to be GOD"

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyCXUgmd6nU&ab_channel=Filli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyCXUgmd6nU&ab_channel=Fillip)p

In morning thought i will eat after finishing maths encoding of formulaes then exercise then eat but it was taking way longer than anticipated and the time kept

Mom was pesking me lot eat eat, (It kind of made feel nice cuz i am doing something that is evoking so big rxn from mom)

I was in flow my focus wasn't wavering.

, so i agreed on eating daal, since i don't like it, so i am not breakuing the rule,

Then it moved to drinking milk, fruits

I was like okay cuz i will be eating boiled eggs instantly i am not gratifying itself but mommy went on ahead to make egg curry,

My work would habve taken upto 9:30pm.

But i noticed my mood, motivation and nergy for work is heading tro ruin cuz of damn milk, fruits, daal

IT MADE me realize my mistake and i declared from now on i will eat @1 of night cuz eating ruins my mood but

MOM got little subangry she said i am saying the same damn thing, i will just eat, just eat and didn't ate now i willnt eat even the fresh and hot egg curry,

I thought becoz mom worked so hard and has been thinking of me for so long maybe i should keep her heart. More and more excuse popped and i gave into temptation.

I thought i should full meal now (Cake from yesterday, egg curry, mix veg)

Currently it's 9:22

I feel like shit, i had focus and string drive & pride in my heart since morning since i was sticking to my discipline and resolve but now i have fallen down.

I don't feel drive, my eyes are getting sleepy,

My mind is reminiding me of how others will berate me and laugh at me and loneliness

ARound 10-15min ago, i was taking bath, i looked at image of model in shampoo packet, my mind reminded me of getting GF, true happpiness lies there, only that will fulfill you,

Also you have wasted the day and all efforts and everything by breaking resolve and eating, so tyou should masturbate to shed off these -ve heavy feelings due to guilt and all my past burdens, you can start fresh from tommorow but i am glad i was able to take reins back at last moment.

Pavadiya failed to make me happy for long term or remove my drive or desire,

Don't believe that shit.

David goggins words taht work hardest when you don't feel like it or hate it are bringing little strength to my fading will.

Yes, even if i feel like shit and so much guilt and shame, i won't let it stop me from working, i will not escape from them by watching porn or songs or anything else

I won't have much happiness for me in future eitherway so atleast work on making yourself proud if you can't happy, self-respect aleast gain that

# Day 27

WHEN YOU ARE EDGING JEE MAIN (25 Days) 2nd ATTEMPT

Constantly keep saying to them 'i haev lot of work and very little time'

Then on 15 Days Left to this

Work super hard, not eating shit (24hr+), not bathing, not sleeping (24hr+) mom-dad show concern

ignore 4-5 times until THEY SUPER HARD CONFRONTW ITH BOTH MOM AND DAD. NOW IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY

YOU HAVE TO GIVE THOUGH ENOUGH TIME TO GROW i.e. 15DAYS SO THEY ARE GROUNDED IN REALITY THAT YOU WILL DROP 100% wWITHOUT DOUBT.

AND YOU NEED TO GIVE THAT THOUGHT ENOUGH TIME TO SETTLE AD GROW DEEP DEEP ROOTS IN THEIR HEAD difficult to shift superfastly

SAY THAT 'I may get good rank but not get the college and college branch i want, i will take drop next year. If i had 2-3 months i could have done better.

And even if i get college CSE and other high branches have heavy workload,

and since all smart comes and there is RELATIVE CGPA.

I may get good by working really hard CGPA but i will not get enough time for myself and develop hobbies to level i want so 1 year will be enough for that

That way i can go to college next year MORE RELAXED AND SMOOTHLY'

SO In 1 year, i can preprepare lot of things for college

SAY THIS IN AGGRESSIVE BUT LITTLE SAD TONE, SHOW YOU ARE SHAMEFUL AND ASHAMED. CUZ YOU ARE SHAMEFUL YOU WASTED TON OF TIME. YOU DIDN'T LIVE UPTO YOUR POTENTIAL

IMPLANT THE IDEA OF DROP YEAR IN THEIR HEAD AND MAKE THEM PREPARE BEFOREHAND

When going to JEE MAINS 2nd attempt

WHEN JEE ADVANCED OKAY RANK COMES

I may get good by working really hard CGPA but i will not get enough time for myself and develop hobbies to level i want so 1 year will be enough for that EVERYTHING WILL BE STRESSFUL

That way i can go to college next year MORE RELAXED AND SMOOTHLY

WITH BETTER RANK. EVEN IF I JUST REVISE I CAN EASILY GET MUCH MUCH HIGHER RANK THAN THIS.

SHOW YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH RANK, AND IIT = STRESSFUL so give me extra And even if i get college CSE and other high branches have heavy workload,

and since all smart comes and there is RELATIVE CGPA.

I may get good by working really hard CGPA but i will not get enough time for myself and develop hobbies to level i want so 1 year will be enough for that

That way i can go to college next year MORE RELAXED AND SMOOTHLY'

THIS WILL BE YOUR LAST LIE! YOUR LAST INDIRECT ATK AND SCHEMING TO MY PARENTS!

# Day 28

Actually i didn't need all that lying that i thought i would have to do yesterday.

Mom (in middle room hall) was tallking with suyash tio check alll fields on net and choose one aim.

I explained to my aim get job, and focus on writting novel and drawing.

From there conversation happened, about me taking drop and everything,

Mom told me she took a drop her dad got paralyzed so she had to take care of him, she wanted 1 year to study for Mains, she had qualified prelims, but BUT

But she failed in MSC admission exam to university

And conversation turned to aovbut more thiungs,

Mom told me you will get burnout

I told mom, i am already out of that.

I also told her dad asked me if not get good marksthen in DROP year wheter i will go to kota or @home?

Then after that mom again come to my room started talking

she told she never knew about my interest in writting

And burnout too

WHen happened

I told previous year in november december when i was sleeping randomly

Mom asked why didn't you tell me

We werent talking that much during that time and stuff..

Mom told me that i should share everything

SHe will support in whatever i do.

It Was Good, I am Kind Of Glad I had This Conversation.

My body was in very weird emotional state after that and i felt i won't be abel to concentrate like this.Plus this was a good moment.

To shed off this emotinal state which was boit restless, i should loose myself in fantasy watch a good scene from jobless reincarnation from random and since empty-stomach (I have been fasting from night to now 3:00 afternoon) i won't be babel to loose myself in it let's eat little namkin.

IT DIDN'T HELP AT ALL!

From tehre i watched videso this that

In end i read nhentai to shed it all off and nhentai worked

BUT BEING DEPENDENT ON NHENTAI FOR EMOTIONAL CONTROL IS EXTREMLY WEAK. I WILL LEARN TO ENDURE AND STAND EMOTIONS, EVEN IF THEY IMPARE WORK I WILL NOT CARE AND JUST DO MY WORK, UNTIL IT NATURALLY GO AWAY

OR ACTUALLY I WILL EXERCISE TO SHED OFF EMOTIONS.

FROM NEXT TIME WHEN YOU FEEL AN EMOTONAL STATE HAS FILLED YOU AND IT WON'T LEAVE AND LET YOU CONCENTRATE THEN TOO FOCUS ON WORK AND IGNORE, WAIT FOR IT TO PASS AWAY

4;45 - LET'S START NEW AGAIN. I WILLN'T GIVE UP. I WILL NOT GIVE IN TO DESIRE OF WHY BOTHER? WHY WORK SO HARD? WHY SUFFER SO MUCH? I WANT TO CHOOSE PATH I WILL BE PROUD OF ON MY DEATH BED. I WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DESCIION THIS TIME FOR SURE!

I failed again.

When mom asked me for milk i refused.x

but then i said if i get chocos i will eat.

I lied to myself it's normal

Then after few minutes after that.

mom went on giving me egg, orangem, apple.

then i studied little, then i felt little sleepy, i thought i will take little nap,

but when i woke up from nap, i was feeling wanting to sleep again(not sleepy, but wanting to sleep)

I asked mom to give me food quickly, so i can shove it in and then go to sleep and that's what i did.

# Day 29

I woke up early due to me sleeping early yesterday. i thought i will sleep more otherwise in night i will sleepy and won't be able to last, i slept, again woke up, i hthought i will sleep again, i couldn't my mouth was dry, drink water, tried to immerse myself in fantasy

Failed, i starting to have horny fantasy then, from there to masturbating, then picking up phone to see if new chapter uploaded in porno novel online series i was following, it wasn't there so i read another one.

This alll was truly a waste of time.

8:20

My mom told me yesterday when i went to sleep, after few hours @night farmers came to home because they wanted to talk, they were ringing bell continously.

Everyone was awake except me.

But father got angry,

He took lathi and beat all of the farmers ]saying 'mera bachha so rha hai'

he beated them took them to guard and scold guard why did he send thme to their adress.

Also mom told that father asked me about ktoa or home question that day

cause he knew that i wasn't taking tset series so my syllabus must not be complete, mom told him that i awas aiming for march attempt.

Earlier the thing that bothered me was - I thought they wou;ld be disappointed with me, for not even completling and finishing the syllabus even though i have been doing this for so damn long

# Day 30

I did everything grt from first thing in morning, BUT ONLY MISTAKE WAS i give in to lust when house was empty, it felt like it';s very good opportunity to not utilize fully

for expression. i wmay not get environment like this in long time.

I should reward myself now cuz in future it's time for claiming nhentai reward, i would not have opportunity like this.

Unproductive time from 12:15-4:00 (In little litlle something something)

NO CHIPS OR BISCUIT FOR TONIGHT. TRY NEXT DAY

# Day 31

I REDISCOVERED ANDREW TATE AND THIS TIME I REALLY LISTENED TO WHO HE IS.

What he says.

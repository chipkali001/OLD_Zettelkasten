I remeber it was another day, i wasted one more day. I failed to make any forward movement towards completing syllabus or even just fixing myself but shame has long ago lost its strength fazing me or better thing to say would be i have become more proficient in deflecting it.

Well anyway i was creating omlete for myself while watching jobless reincarnation, my plan was to eat and go to sleep while utilising the episode i will be watching as a fodder to stir my creative imagination.

And when suddenly the scene where the intro song of the anime began playing of episode23 (the last episode).

Villagers were showing seeds in the field that has been degraded after the mana clamatity.

While this song was playing in background

" If you're afraid cross the mountain and go

The overflowing water will heal your unsatisfied heart

Beyond imagination

A place where nobody can stand ."

The first 4 lines were the ones that just touched my soul, I felt so filled and as if my whole body and skin is radiating a deep cool wind from my center to right outward from boundary.

I feel that sensation often but this time it was really really intense.

So intense that i still remeber this even after who knows after so many months.

Why couldn’t I just

stay home from school? My mother wouldn’t hear of it, but I was

totally embarrassed by everything. The clothes I was wearing

looked weird, I had no books or homework, and my backpack

was gone. I had my life in that backpack! The more I tried to fit in,

the worse it got. Was I destined to be an outcast and a geek all my

life? That’s what it felt like. I didn’t want to grow up, change or

have to handle life if it was going to be this way. I just wanted to

curl up and die.

I walked around school like a zombie. Everything felt surreal,

and I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. All the security I

had known, from my old school, my friends, my house and my

cat had all been ripped away

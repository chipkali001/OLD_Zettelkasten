With Nishu, i prepared for robotics competition, in that room which was on corner, made of glass, we wanted to print the arena on white paper,

Aman gulia was the one Harsh and I blamed for missing bolts.

In first competition with Harsh and Aman we messed up and our performance wasnt really that great. We were thinking how could have used BLUETOOTH as secret hand.
In second too Gagan bhiya was able to sort out scara robot which circle around arena, it was our experience

Refreshment there were nice.
I remeber we had to stand on line outside maybe thery were puttign tag on robot, all robots aligned in garden/ground with  box number to it, like one with shoes, there was drone flying, rudra house was near.

There was an Jhula in front of schoolâ€™s big gate that i loved to put it in perpetual circular motion by adjusting my COM

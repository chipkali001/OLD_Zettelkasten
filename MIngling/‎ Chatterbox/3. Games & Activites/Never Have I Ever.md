NEVER HAVE I EVER RULES

So there are two ways to play “Never have I ever”. Depending on your age and what you are comfortable with, you can pick the game that works for you and your friends. Or you could just say “Never have I ever…” and have your friends say if they have done it or not.

The (non-drinking) points game

The first way to play “Never have I ever…” is to sit or stand in a circle. Then one person says something that they haven’t done. “Never have I ever broken something at a friend’s house and not told them.” If you have broken something at a friend’s house and not told your friend, then you lose a point. Then the next person says something they haven’t done “Never have I ever…” and so on.

You have ten points to start and when you don’t have any more points you are out of the game. You can keep track of your points on your fingers or draw circles and cross them out on a piece of paper. The last person with points left wins the game.

If only one person has done the thing from the question, they are usually asked to tell the story of how it happened.

The drinking game

The second way of playing is with sips of a drink instead of points.

Everyone forms a circle or sits around a table and one person starts out “Never have I ever been stranded on the side of the road.” If someone has been stranded on the side of the road they take a drink. Then it goes to the next person. And they say “Never have I ever…” and round and round it goes.

There isn’t really a winner but there are definitely people who end up drinking a lot more than others. Usually the game stops when people get too drunk or the questions get too embarrassing.

If only one or two people take a drink, usually the group will ask for details or a story. But if no one drinks then the person who said “Never have I ever…” drinks.

A word of warning if you are playing the drinking game. The game can get out of hand pretty quickly. So drink responsibly. Also, ask questions responsibly. There have been many a friendship that have ended over a game of “Never have I ever…”

Remember to keep it fun

No matter which version you are playing make sure to keep things relatively light and fun. No one has fun when the questions start getting too dark or emotionally scarring.

Remember the point of the game is to get to know your friends a little bit better and find out some interesting things about them. So have fun with it and don’t get too serious or make the questions too awkward to answer. You can use some of these questions as is, or use them as idea starters for your own questions.

LIST OF NEVER HAVE I EVER QUESTIONS

Careful if you have former or current waiters/waitresses at the party, they are liable to chew out the people who said they did this on.

Probably like the 3rd most fun thing you can do underwater. Under the sea, under the sea!

Elevator dance parties. Got to love them.

23. Never have I ever had a treehouse.

Glasses. Fashion for your face! While it used to be a social stigma to wear glasses, now it’s trendy.

Forks, spoons, glasses, plates, who is the restaurant robber in your group?

29. Never have I ever woken up and couldn’t move.

This is a common occurrence in a lot of people, where your brain is awake, but your body isn’t. Even if you haven’t had it happen to you, it’s probably happened to someone in the group.

30. Never have I ever been trapped in an elevator.

Perhaps you won’t get any takers for this one, but if you do there is bound to be a good story behind it. Especially if there were other people in the elevator. It’s a sitcom trope, so it has to have happened to some folks, right?

Who is the next level texter in your group? Chances are they are texting during this game…

If anyone in your group has, make sure to ask them how it turned out. I’ve never heard of someone falling in love at first sight, and then everything turned out well. Usually it turns into a train wreck. Humans are weird.

39. Never have I ever sung karaoke in front of people.

Maybe you can even get some folks in the group to do some impromptu karaoke. Just not too much. Karaoke is like salt, sometimes less is more.

47. Never have I ever had to run to save my life.

Disclaimer: can definitely become a downer really quick. Running from animals, funny. Running from humans is a mixed bag with mostly trauma and depressing stuff in it.

48. Never have I ever made money by performing on the street.

Whether it was for fun, for a bit of extra money, or because they fell on hard times. You might discover that someone in your group has a hidden talent.

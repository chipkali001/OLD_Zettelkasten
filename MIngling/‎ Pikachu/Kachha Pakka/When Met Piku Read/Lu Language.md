**Effort**
To be honest i am not really materialistic so physical objects in itself dont hold much value for me.
but i like effort & dedication, so hand-made things or just something that i knew took your effort will make me happy but object in itself really doesnt matter.

**Words affection** 
BASIC NEED - Considerate & Acknowledgment 
Dont try to compliment - It will decrease value of your words. OR i will feel youâ€™re enforcing an expectation on me OR maybe like an image of me.
Show of Affection -be interested in things i care about   - things i like - you DONT NEED TO LIKE it just be INTERESTED IN IT WHETER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

I yawn as I leave the house 
During the walk to school, I can’t help but close my eyes due to the sunlight.  
Aaah, it's so bothersome.  
Lately, I've been starting to feel weak under the sun.It feels like the sunlight is piercing through my skin and I can’t stand it.  

(BEST way to DESCRIBE PAIN DUE TO SUNLIGHT IS - **PIERCING MY SKIN**)
Don’t repeat “it’s **as if** sunlight is” vs “it **feels** **like** the sunlight”

“I got some nice stuff”.  
Matsuda opens his bag, and tips out the things inside his bag without any hesitation.  
The books and DVDs which are being piled up on my desk have suggestivetitles.  
“Hee!”  
A small scream comes from a girl far away from us.  
Well, of course she will react like that. After all, something like this is happening in the morning.  
What I hear next from the girls are discriminating comments like “You guys are the worst~” and “Die, filthy brats”.  
“Silence! This is our entertainment! Girls and kids should look away and keep away! Or else, I will rape all of you inside my head!”  
Your words are vulgar as always, Matsuda-kun.

“I got some nice stuff”/“*They are finally here*”/“” 
Matsuda opens his bag, and **tips out** the things inside his bag without any hesitation.  
*The door to the room opens up, and group of knights magnanimously marches into the room.*
The books and DVDs which are being piled up on my desk have suggestivetitles.  
*The knights who entered were wearing full armor which had an horse enigma imprinted on them.*
“Hee!”  
*clank* *Ugh sorry*
A small **scream comes from**(expalain sound) a girl far away from us.  
*The scream came from frightened maid who accidently dropped an teacup*
Well, of course she will react like that (react to girl). (react to friend’s action) After all, something like this is happening in the morning in the broad day light.  
*Well ofcourse cat will be frightened of the knight. After all, she was the one stealing their breakfast in broad day light*
**What I hear next** from the girls are discriminating/dergoitary comments like “You guys are the worst~” and “Die, filthy brats”.  
“Silence! This is our entertainment! Girls and kids **should look away and keep away**! *Or else*, I will rape all of you inside my head!”  
*i hear mummer amongst other servants “Who is she?” ”She is the noobie who joined few days ago” “She will surely be kicked out”
“Silence. Instead of chit-chatting, i will prefer you all cleanup this mess fast or from tommorow you all can chat just at your home”*
Your words are vulgar as always, Matsuda-kun.

O-Oh well, here at the entrance I won't get wet any longer.
Damnit! I struggled to keep my heavy eyelids from closing as blood continue to flow out of my wound like a fountain, atthis pace i am not going to last long.

***EXLAMATION event + event's effect***
(instead of two differbt sentences I am finally at entrance, i wont get wet an longer - FOCUS ON TWO THINGS - focus is one flow,one stream sentene)

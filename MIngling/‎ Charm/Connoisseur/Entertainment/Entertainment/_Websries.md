# Dark 




# MoneyHeist 



# Flash
i thoroughly enjoyd the time i watched it but when i watched the new season after little break, i felt bored




# The family man
I like dialogues

Why can't he have job description he works in army and it's confidential for security of family and others?

He should have told terrorist he is in helpless situation nd surrounded by everywhere. Terrorist would have no choice to surrender.

OH SO SHE KNOWS HE WORKS OFR SECURITY.

THEN SHE HAS TO BE LITTLE UNDERSTANDING

Was kind of nice but i was more immersed in wheter the wife will cheat or not than the actual plot.

Peaky blinder- watched first episode.BORED

Still hooligan calls his mnnother whore and they start to fight.

Bss Hogya.

MAYBE I WAS TOO QUICK TO JUDGE BUT I DIDN’T DIND IT ENGAGING ENOUGH TO CONTINUE. I like too loose myself

I THINK I WAS TOO QUICK TOO JUDGE

I donm’t like gangster type films .(godfather - boring)


# Kingdom(2019)

Complete hooked, enjoyed it.

Season one ended at cliffhanger and i am looking forward to next season. I will maybe watch it on a good day


# LOCKE AND KEY

Nice but i don’t enjoy the kid protagonist and stuff.

# Laughter in Waikikki

Episode1 - was good, they have too exaggerated emotions but htat must be a cultural thing so. It’s nice & FUNNY.


# Prison Break

Hmm… i liked it. Dialogues were nice BUT… ugh what did you liked about prison break was it a cunning protagonist? I have read lot of novels now so it felt normal to me,

So i liked to level where if i am watching i will watch next episode procastinating BUT i didnt have desire to just see what’ll happen in normal state or care or remebre if i have even finished it.



# LUCIFER
Enjoyed and want to watch season2.
When lucifer oblisously leak out what chloe said about her mom (childish & forced to grew up stuff) it was so funny

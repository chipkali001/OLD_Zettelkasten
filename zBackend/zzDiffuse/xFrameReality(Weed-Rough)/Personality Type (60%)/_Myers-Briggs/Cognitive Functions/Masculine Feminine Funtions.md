**Thinking masculine** - Punchy Pushy, bossy, why things should or sohuldnt work like this
**Thinking feminine** - my thoughts could easily ahnge, options can work here

**Masculine Fe & Te may look same.**
**Feminine Feelings** - soemtimes i value these feelings & sometimes i dont. Value is movable.

<font color="#8064a2">Demon sensory - doesnt even look at cup & spills it </font>
**Masculine Sensing** - will really hit punch, better memory of things happened in past & timeline.
Even demon sensory even if ant remember right away they will be able to go away & pikup on that time/period & latch back onto it.
<font color="#f79646">This may spill lets move it</font>
**Feminine Sensing -** very gentle with reality, facts are fluid & 
things that did or didnâ€™t happen could be let to interpretation
<font color="#f79646">**This may or may not spill & walks <font color="#f79646">away</font>**</font>


**Masculine Intution**- this is what could be & this is the best way/route to get there'. this is ideal plan
**Feminine Intution** - I see where there is but we can take multiple routes NO RIGITY needed

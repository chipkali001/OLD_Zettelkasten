Casting judgement on someone give you feeling that now you are above them.


My desire is to be looked eye-to-eye neither up or down - to be listened to

parents are given free pass to act this way.

they dont have to be considerate/listen since they are right 

those who critiise everything INStANtANEOUSLY without even considering the point where person came from are really dumb, they may fool themselves to think they are smart but they are not.
Its so so easy to just take a part of something someone said, extrapolate & expand it then criticise it & say YOU ARE DUMB tHIS IS WRONG
but they are the one who is stupid


I SEEK POWER & SUCESS & SHINY tHINGS O ADORNE MYSELF WItH - so theyâ€™l lissten & look up & look down.

Hey may see of themselves as detached smart person (they are little not denying that) but they arent in essence detached and dare i say more poor than teh non-detached since their ego/arrogane lock them in & they only take in info or critisice to validate tehir superiority. hey are shallow & lack depth & astuteness to ennjoy the subtly they just judge only coarse info to have fun.

Yes, You may have heard **Personality isnt fixed you can change it let me shed light on FIRST what it really means then how its not really the case and it is at same time**.
Let me first say that TENDENCY DONT CHANGE, YOUR PERCEPTION OF WORLD MAY CHANGE BUT TENDENCIES DEEP REMAINS THE SAME, THAT IS KIND OF ESSCENCE.
It would automatically feel inutive if you finish all of this but.. sei t like this.
Age perception expand and things that were invisble due to whatever becomes visible. Example = may shyness may be something that was blocking me from seeing a whole world so i by overcoming that i can see more, the world shy agrim thought vs me, i am at much vast place.
So aging or being put in a position where your present reality is burned.
THAT IS **SO IN THAT SENSE PERSONALITY IS EVERCHANGING BUT AT SAMETIME IT REALLY ISNT**
Like let’s say my taste to  be my personality.
When i saw an weird food(PERCEPTION), I dont eat thsi stuff it looks like gobar ke leep, but maybe i accidently taste it and wheter i like, dislike, hate, how much like has been decided by DNA of my tongue, even before choice of tasting non tasting happens.
*WILL YOU SUDDENLY START TO LIKE ROCK-CLIMBING if you haven’t liked till now, PERCEPTION BARRIER ISN’T BLOCKING, TASTE isn’t everything you can learn and be anything.*
Can you eat things you dont like, reach places where your taste tendency dont allow, YES, you can broaden perception but will your taste change. No.

###### Only here tell stuff relevant IN CONTEXT of INTEGRATION QUESTION - don't reveal all you have in ONE - break it into long lectures IN WAY - where you spend lot of time talking on EACH - it will make you look smart - if you will slowly pickup EACH TOPIC go in indepth & talk at hours at each will MAKE YOU LOOK so smart & so wise & so spiritual. 



ANSWER is PSYCHOLOGICAL CONFIGURATION.

**AND I HAVE DEVELOPED MY WAY OF SEEING - through lot of sources OKAY let's start with**
why is this even a problem - Answer is WE ARE DIVIDED - we have different subsections of personality within us - all want different things - we identify ourselves with few subsections & repress suppress the other one. AND if you suppress it, it'll come out in unconsious way. 
**THERE'S THIS CONCEPT of** - **EGO & UNCONSIOUS**
example - I will assert SELF-CONTROL but something distract us - we can try to suppress it again and again - but eventually we may automatically give ourselves reasoning - just little break - thoda enjoy 

# Karmic-State 
1. CULTIVATING AWARENESS of KARMIC-STATE.
(......)
2. DESIRE/URGES throws us INTO Karmic-State THAT binds self
3. You can actually ENTER Karmic-State - by visualizing/thinking/feeling/meditating on it - don't use dopamine way & HERE enters concept of KARMA.
**THESE KARMIC STATE - are MIX of biological, environmental, nurture,...**


## Why did i used word KARMIC and CONCEPT of Karma 
You may have heard of LOT OF KACHDA so I'll tell you REAL-BASED Defination would be - 
**it's concept of things - adding up - law of compounding - law of interest**
**The positive and negative both compounds - you reap what you sow - SPIRITUAL WEALTH**
'Noone gets away with their sins - you have to eventually pay the price'
**let's discuss it in context of this** 
### Negative KARMA
if you knew you are supposed to do ABC but you did XYZ - mind can try to tell that - it's one time event.
Barrier to do it again WILL be reduced & if not do - then that builds INTEGRITY in self
- you are making it EASIER for you to DO it AGAIN - it's not an CLOSURE (That it's last time) (food you did tommorow) - it will compound - it will become easier for you to redo-it. 
##### SO FIRST IS HOW-NOT-TO-FALL below OR STAY-AT-LOW
1. ***Turning off AUTO-PILOT- being cognisant towards pliability of mind so you don't cascade down in body's tendency to take path of least resistance. Little lies - little adjustment IN how you explain your action away - will make you more of an liar***
2. Don't stack dopamine or Use dopamine to make transition by stacking stuff - like listening to music.
    When you feel internal resistance while doing work - YOU HAVE TO TELL you - this is **RESISTANCE IS FUN - THIS IS GOOD**  (the stuff who to numb down - you may even have wanted to listen to music in first place)


### Positive Karma - PROCESS OF PURIFICATION  - 
Small positive corrections add up - you dual it w/ Energy State & Not Stacking-Dopamine - body will become purer & will DEVLOP INTEGRITY. - We'll GET ON TRACK with WHAT we WANTED
**ONE MORE THING is IF YOU DO EXERCISE then you'll FEEL that you HAVE AN immunity to ot be phased **
**EXERCISE that are HARD - WILL give you LOT OF +positive Karma in regards to SELF-CONTROL** 
from outside it may feel like - i'm busy for exercise - exercise what? -  BUT IT GIVE YOU LOT OF POWER 
	I AM NOT TALKING OF YOGA - something that's difficult 
#### IT'S AN PROCESS OF EXPITATION
Expiation,Â the Christian doctrine of Christ <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">DYING</mark> to absolve the world's <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">SINS.</mark>

### BLESSING & MOTIVATION 
"[!Quote] Picturing for other a **SPECIAL-FUTURE** for someone and **ACTIVE-COMMITMENT** to the other to help realize that future". 

**BLESSING TRADITION/Concept/Working** is based on **WE get VITALITY from simply BEING WITNESSED/ACKNOWLEDGED** - you bless someone else - 

BLESSING OURSELVES - mirror - ACKNOWLEDGE HARD & DIFFICULT - putting FAITH in YOU - you can break it BUT you know it already - breaking it won't fill you - you'll forget

Now blessing self - concept comes from cancer patient mental exercise - love part of body small - can be arch of nose, something small, then take as much time it takes & extend it to whole BODY. 

**CONCEPT OF BLESSING POSITIVE-KARMA through SACRIFICE - bring luck**

EVEN PEOPLE bless themselves THROUGH GOD 
And also MOTIVATIONAL-VIDEOS. 

**Wow but wait** - You in instinct way know - SUPPOSE someone uses GOD to BLESS himself - GIVE themselves MOTIVATION **WHO WILL YOU BET on WILL MAKE BETTER STRIDES**
 
THE DIFFERENCE is VIDEO one IS DOPOMINE-URGIC (loud voice, intensity) whearas GODS is based on SOMETHING DEEPER within US
YOU & I MAY OR MAY-NOT believe in GOD or EVEN IF YOU Do - you have - SUCH STRONG FAITH - THAT you will be able TO LIE TO SELF & get ENERGY
**THAT'S WHY WE'LL DISCUSS ABOUT THIS & HOW TO USE THIS FORCE-ENERGY to BRING STRENGTH & STABILITY** (GOD=KING-ENERGY)

LETTING KING ENERGY possess INSTINCUTAL MIND for ORDER, STABLITY - is all KING ENERGY

# 
Now let's see what WE HAVE DISCUSSED is more of Earthly Things
I GROUNDED concept OF KARMA in 

ONE LEVEL DEEPER than KARMA
AND DISCUSSING BLESSING MORE 
Not any exercise- yoga - but one that IS difficult 


- Now i will DISUCSS MORE **METAPHYSICAL** THINGS

# 

Developing Awareness of Karmic-State Beginning BUT it's NOT ENOUGH for 
Now we aren't animals - we aren't RESTRICTED by OUR KARMIC STATE - We can see them & modulate
PHYSCIAL TALK - 
1. We'll discuss EMPOWERING MODULATOR <== Conscious Force
2. Corruption & Divine  <== Unconscious Force 
	INSTINCTUAL MIND 
	ARCHETYPES to USE POWER of INSTINCTUAL MIND

# Instinctual Mind 
Let's define conscious mind, unconscious mind. 
CONSCIOUS MIND - this is my ego, self we identify as self, it's capable of connecting distant, low processing power.
UNCONSIOUS MIND - Pattern detection machine,
UNCONSCIOUS MIND can process MUCH MUCH more than your CONSCIOUS MIND can ever. 
**INSTICTUAL MIND is the WHISPER of CONSCIOUS MIND. 
Conscious mind is IMPOTENT without INSTICTUAL MIND
handpicking UNCONSCIOUS CONTENTS**
1. **LOOK AT ME- how many things my body is doing - am i consciously modulating meri speech kaisi hogi, meri tone - it's only two/three so my tone is different if an different person was there it would change. there are SO MANY CALCULATIONS are GOING ON - in just ACT OF ME TALKING THIS**
2. Let's say i am angry mode - and I AM PROJECTING it onto you - THE THING that DOES the PROJECTION is what i referring as INSTINCTUAL MIND here - now what will happen - i will pull up record - you did ABC on that, you are always like this, ABC, XYZ whatever EARLIER my conscious mind has SUPPRESED or LET-GO of or FORGIVEN - just think how - my mind JUST DID - an GLOBAL SEARCH - so many things, memories, and stuff are in my mind & in an instant PULLED UP record - that i don't even think that much consciously 
3. BEST EXAMPLE LANGUAGE - you instinctually know if i am saying an sentence with wrong grammar, each words pronunciation - how will tongue move - did someone taught you where will tongue touch - how all letters will interact for an pronunciation, how did i learn to move my hands like this. <span style="color:#ffff00">JUST IMAGINE a PERSON who can speak is SO SO SMART</span>
I can give you infinite examples & that's topic in itself
###### Only here tell stuff relevant IN CONTEXT of INTEGRATION QUESTION - don't reveal all you have in ONE - break it into long lectures IN WAY - where you spend lot of time talking on EACH - it will make you look smart
LANGUAGE is THE BEST medium to see.
TELL ME "Aur (hindi word) MEANING" - i am foreigner - you can take as many words or time you can - tell me what word **Aur** can be used as **Aur Bhai** you can't use and like that
It can be used to say OR too, not just And
SUPPOSE you were telling me an story - i say 
Aur? (authroitative, arrogant)
And can be used to be authroitative, curious NATURALLY 


### Difference in how conscious mind & unconscious mind works & INSTINCTUAL-MIND powers 


UNCONSIOUS too WAVY - YOU CAN NAIL DOWN stuff - INSTINCTUAL MIND becomes sharper - How it search - IT ALL REFLECTS in LANGUAGE  




**INSTINCTUAL MIND** - one of the best way, you can SHARPEN & GET in touch with is focusing on LANGUAGE & thinking of lingustics let me give examples
**AND HOW PEOPLE use LANGUAGE HELPS you to GET PEAK into configuration of UNCONSCIOUS MIND of others**





SEE WHAT I DEFINE INSTINCUTAL MIND for ME is 
IT'S THE MIND - that brings the contents of unconsious into reality. YOU CAN ACCESS IT - but it's not an conscious control but an INSTINCTUAL/unconscious one.
INSTINCTUAL MIND regulates KARMIC-STATE.
It's an UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
EX1 - I
EX2 - 

I normally in my lexicon REFER to body as UNCONSIOUS & Mind as CONSIOUS 
VERY VERY VAST TOPIC

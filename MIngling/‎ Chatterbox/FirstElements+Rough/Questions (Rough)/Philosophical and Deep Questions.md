-   Is there inherent order in nature or is it all chaos and chance?
-   What is the best path to find truth; science, math, art, philosophy, or something else?
-   Is math something that humans created or something we discovered? Is looking at reality mathematically an accurate representation of how things work?
-   There has always been something. Before there was something, there was only nothing. Which do you think is more likely?
-   As more and more is being discovered about quantum physics, we become less and less able to comprehend the nature of reality. Is this something temporary and our minds will adapt and begin to understand this new reality or is it possible that the human mind will soon reach its limits of comprehension? If it’s only temporary, is there is a limit to what the human mind can comprehend? If we are reaching our limits, how do we continue to study our reality?

Also, what are the ramifications of every single person’s reality being a little different and unique to them?

Rudra and I was playing a little complicated shooting game (We used to remove refill from pen, tie a rubber band in a little complicated way using a pin.) (I too dont have perfect memory of howo it was made.) (All I know it was like, you pull back the string along with refil and shoot)  Now we both were on duty in class. We decided to play game where we will see who woll get more hits on each other. I was hiding on window wall side 3rd row and rudra was on the door wall side 1st row of class and we were hitting each other and that is when principal mam caught us and scholeded us what will happen if refill hits someone’s eye.



Rudra me in class everyone else gone.

He wanted to go to washroom but we were here illegakly and he was mam's kid who held high position so eevry teacher can easily identify him

So if he go outside someone will pull him in for questioning.

Are you serious

Thodi dignity too rkho aur mee yha hu8n kya kh

I COULDN"T EMAPTHISE WITH HIS POSITION I WAS LIKE JUST GO~ Who cares~

He asked and said

Should I use bottle of one of the kids

AND I WAS LIKE OH! Are you joking

He was saerious.

I grabbed him and stop

HE TRIED TO TAKE MY BOTTLE NOW. NO STAY AWAY,

NO ONE WILL KNOW!

Idiot I am here, SHOW SOME DIGNITY,

I PUSHED HIM OUT OF CLASS.

He came back relaxed we were hiding behind each rows and throwing pen refills through reubberband sysyttem.

We will see who scores more point

Principal came

Scolded us and told

Refil pointed you can hurt each other eye

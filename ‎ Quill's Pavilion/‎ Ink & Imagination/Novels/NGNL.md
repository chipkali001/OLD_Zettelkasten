This part of (My childhood self will relate so much 
Working so hard YET Ayush for somereason easy, STANFORD & CJC both
Everything random unfair)
That it was the most fail kind of game ever.
>[!Note]
…A stupid game with no clear rules or goal. Seven billion players all taking
their turns whenever they wanted. Penalized if you won too much.—The sister
who, thanks to being too smart, was alone and bullied with no one to understand
her. Penalized if you lost too much.—
The brother who kept failing and getting yelled at by his teachers and parents, yet kept smiling. No right to pass. The bullying only got worse if she was silent. **If she spoke too much, she’d be hated for crossing a line**. And he’d be **hated for seeing through to people’s true
motives**. There was no way to tell the goal, read the stats, or even identify the genre. Even if you followed the rules that were laid out, you’d be punished—and
worst of all: those who just ignored the rules stood at the top—. Compared to this awful life, any other game was just too easy.

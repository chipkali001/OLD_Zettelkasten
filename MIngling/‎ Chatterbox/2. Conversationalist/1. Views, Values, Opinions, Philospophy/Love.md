 give life otherwise it will destroy all purity of everything i build and stood on.






I guess intimacy means a sacred space you only give access to special people. I expect piku set to 1 OTHERWISE i will it just as being parasitic. like having bff or friends after break - its parasitic. it decreases VALUE for that person & they are impure-promiscuos.
YOU YOURSELF SHOULD DEFEND & PROTECT SACREDNESS.
Dont react emotionally -*like saying YOUâ€™RE DISSAPOINTED you had expectations of them. NO!*
Ask whats your values? what do you think _ is? Is it okay for _ to do  __ .

Kisse marr]] - agge smbhl self
 Human matters cuz REGARDLESS Of Social Construct They Identity themselves at core in tendency IS WHAT MATTERS. So as 
Love and arranged marriage.
Who i marry is important than how i marry.
In objective sense
--
And my subjective definition from how i see world love and marry are different.
"I don't think you can really marry if you don't love other person"
Question itself is wrong.
"Love marriage"&"Arranged marriage" are just social construct i am talking in emotional subjective sense not in world of logic but meaning 
Shallow and empty constructs 

And from what here i mean love is different thing from normal 

Spiritually i can't think possible to be divorced, it would just mean they never really married?

Normal love and marriage things are They are just enacting thing they learned from movies and media and they belive themselves to be pure? 
Whether love or arrange both are just stories other humans have mad e and not reality 

I mean look at divorce rates in people and how they hurt each other later on if that's is their depth of what they call love or smrriage then it's shallow.

"Which i feel like mutual exploitation masturbation and they are trying to enact fantasy that they have collected from movies, novels, etc. They aren't really looking at each other but just tool to fulfill fantasy."
Just look at divorce rate and all their defination of love had only that much depth.
"It's mutual masturbation"
 I believe you can't leave other person until one of you dies that's my defination of love.

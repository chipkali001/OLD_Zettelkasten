LIST OF QUESTIONS TO ASK A GUY OR GIRL OVER TEXT

If you are stuck thinking of questions to ask a guy or girl over text or you just need some ideas to build on we’ve got you covered. Take a look and enjoy! I’m sure you’ll find some of them really useful!

1. What’s your “go to” video or gif for a laugh?

A great way to get a good laugh and have something common to talk about, both now and in the future. Plus you get to see how much their sense of humor matches yours. And if you’ve got some great funny videos tucked away, you can share some of them.

2. Where’s your favorite place to get take away or delivery from?

If you know the place and like it, you can talk about how good it is. If you don’t know it, give it a shot and you’ll have something to talk about next time you text them!

3. What song do you play most often?

Great for getting to know their musical taste and seeing how well it matches up with your own. Plus everyone is passionate about the music they love and chances are they will be more than happy to talk a lot about it.

4. What’s your favorite quote from a movie?

A question that begs for back and forth movie quotes from their and your favorite movies. Plus it’s really easy to branch off and start talking about what movies they like.

5. What’s your “go to” joke?

Everyone loves to laugh, and everyone has at least one joke they know by heart. And you’ll also be able to tell them a few jokes as well. If you are like me and can’t remember many jokes, try the [jokes subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jokes). Just sort by top / month or week.

6. What song has the best intro?

Another question that works well on a phone because after they let you know you can look it up on your phone and have a listen. Then come back and tell them what you thought about it.

7. What is the scariest non banned item you could take on to a plane?

This is more of a creative one. But great for some back and fourth as you both think of scary non banned items. (e.g. parachute, voodoo doll in pilot uniform, full clown outfit, etc.)

8. What’s the (funniest / most disappointing / weirdest / etc.) text you’ve gotten?

This one probably isn’t a good one to lead with, but it’s great after you’ve texted for a bit and need something else to talk about.

9. What is your favorite meme?

Everyone has at least one meme that they really like. You can find out their’s, who know’s maybe it’s the same as yours! Also a great way to get a conversation going solely through memes which is always fun.

10. How many questions can you answer in just pictures?

This one is more of a game really. You ask general, generic questions and they try to answer only through images. Quite fun if they are up to it. It’s like a treasure hunt. But I probably wouldn’t lead with this one, good for later and if they are in a playful mood.

11. What is the most interesting thing you have on you or near you right now? Send me a pic of it.

A unique way to find a new topic to talk about. And you’ll also get an idea of what kinds of things they find interesting.

12. What app on your phone do you think I should get?

This kind of depends on how into apps they are. But everyone has two or three apps that they can’t live without. If you’ve got the one they suggest, then you can talk about what you think about it. If you don’t, well now you’ve got a new app you can check out.

13. What’s the best photo you’ve taken?

Time to give them the chance to show off. We’ve all got pictures that we’ve taken that we really like. Now you get to compliment them on their pride and joy. Definitely a solid question to ask a girl or guy over text.

14. What’s the worst text that you accidentally sent?

Embarrassment is a powerful emotion and if they’ve got a story they are willing to share then that will bring you both a little closer. It’s great to empathize with them and if it isn’t too bad you can do some good natured teasing.

15. What thing do you really wish you could buy right now?

Great because they can send you a link to the product they want and you can check it out. Now you’ve got something to talk about that they are really into.

16. What’s the funniest thing that someone could spend money on / buy on the internet?

Similar to the above question because they can send you the link, but this one takes a little more creativity. Often this one leads to a hilarious stream of funny products and services.

17. What’s the funniest picture you have on your phone?

Similar to earlier video question, and great for the same reason. It gives you something you can both talk about. You could also narrow it down and say the funniest picture of you on your phone.

18. What dumb pickup lines do you know?

Everyone knows some dumb / funny pickup lines. And this question is a great way to get a good back and forth of funny pickup lines going.

19. What are some unwritten rules?

This one is a little bit different than the rest. You could take it in a couple of directions, like unwritten rules between friends or you could go with society at large.

But like many of the other questions to ask a boy or girl over text, it’s great because it’s perfect for back and forth texting as you both think of new rules.

20. What happens in real life but rarely gets portrayed in movies?

Here is another one that might take a little bit of creativity. You can also easily flip it around and ask what happens in movies all the time but rarely happens in real life.

21. What isn’t real but you desperately wish it was?

This one is just fun to answer. Everyone likes to fantasize about the amazing stuff they wish existed.

22. What’s the best “hidden gem” that you’ve found?

Who doesn’t like sharing cool stuff they found? It can be a band, a website, something they bought, really anything. You can let them know it doesn’t have to be really unknown. It can be just something they stumbled across.

23. What’s the silliest thing you are passionate about?

We’ve all got our passions that are less than productive, they keep us sane. And this is a great way to see what they are really into. Something that they might not let everyone know about.

24. What do you hate / love most about your phone?

I’m sure you have a love / hate relationship with your phone, and they probably do too. It can be a general thing like it takes up too much of my time, or a specific feature like the fingerprint scanner.

25. What’s the most ridiculous thing you’ve seen online recently?

This one is another one that will give you both something common to talk about. And it’s easy for them to send you a link to the ridiculous thing so you can check it out.

So that’s it! I hope you’ve enjoyed this list of questions to ask a guy or girl over text. Hopefully you found at least a few questions that will work for you.

If you need even more questions, we’ve got more than a few to offer. Here are just a few others you can check out!

LIST OF QUESTIONS TO ASK A GIRL

This first list of questions to ask a girl is a great place to start. Each question has some commentary that might help with the questions but feel free to ignore the commentary if you want. There’s also many more excellent [questions to ask a girl without commentary](https://conversationstartersworld.com/questions-to-ask-a-girl/#More-questions-to-ask-a-girl) below the first set.

So without further ado, here are our best list of unique questions to ask a woman to get to know here better.

1. Where is the last place you would ever go?

No telling what she’ll come up with for this question. You can get pretty creative with it or you can answer it literally. Either way, it’ll probably require a bit of thought but could lead a really great answer.

2. What are you completely over and done with?

So with this question there really isn’t any way to predict what she’ll say, because there are so many different ways this question can go. She might talk about a current fad or fashion, she might talk about a friend, really it could be anything.

But whatever she chooses to talk about, we all love talking about things that annoy us and she will too!

3. What memory do you just keep going back to?

Perfect for getting to know a little bit more about her. Whether it’s a serious memory or just one of those passing things that sticks with us sometimes, either way it’s a great window into her world.

Just a heads up though, this one can get real serious in a hurry depending on what memory she decides to share.

4. What’s the most immature thing your parents do?

It doesn’t really matter how old someone is, they still do immature things. Sometimes those things are silly and fun, sometimes they are more selfish or hurtful.

Either way, this is a question that she’s probably never been asked before and can lead to some really interesting answers!

5. What is the most unusual fear you have?

A question that can get really funny or really weird. Either way it’s a fun question that people generally like answering. Who knows, you may share an unusual fear!

6. What is your favorite TV show?

Sure this one is a really common question, but it’s great because if you are into the show too you have a ton to talk about. And if you haven’t seen it, now you have a good show to watch. Plus, if you don’t know anything about it she’ll probably enjoy telling you about it.

7. What’s the most ridiculous argument you’ve had?

I can almost guarantee this one will lead to a funny story. One that she will enjoy telling and you’ll enjoy listening to. I’m sure you both have plenty of ridiculous argument stories, especially if you have siblings.

8. What do you wish people would stop asking you?

At every stage of life, you hear questions over and over again. Whether it’s questions about your future, questions about life circumstances, or questions about personal things. Everyone gets asked the same questions over and over again.

9. What’s the biggest lesson life has taught you?

More of a serious question but it can be a really good beginning to a conversation. Plus, you’ll learn more about what makes her who she is and why she is the way she is now.

10. What is increasingly becoming socially acceptable?

You might learn some about what movements she supports or doesn’t support. But really this question is more about starting an interesting conversation about society.

Just remember, it’s okay that people have different viewpoints than you. This isn’t a debate. You aren’t trying to convince her you are right.

11. What pictures or paintings have had a big impact on you?

This is also one she probably hasn’t been asked before and she might have never thought about it. But I can almost guarantee that examples will leap to her mind when you ask her the question. This is question is pretty cool because you can pull up the pictures / painting up on your phone. You’ll probably get to see some cool pictures you’ve never seen.

12. What movie or book character are you most similar to?

If nothing else, this question will tell you how she views herself or who she wants to be more like. Always good to know, and a lot fun think about as well. There is a reason those quizzes are so popular on social media.

You could split the question into two parts, which character do you wish you could be more like and which do you think you are actually like. Or move the conversation into what books and movies she is into. You could also talk about which characters are the most interesting or unique.

13. What part of your culture are you most and least proud of?

Our culture makes up a large part of who we are and she is no different. This one can get a bit deep but it’s definitely fertile ground for a good conversation. So dive in on cultural matters and see where you both have similar viewpoints and where you differ. There will be lots of chances for follow up questions. Just remember, listen and ask questions; don’t just think of the next thing you are going to say.

14. What’s the worst and best thing about being female?

A great question that she is sure to have plenty to say about. If you are severely grossed out by feminine body stuff you might be tempted to give it a pass. But who knows, you might actually learn some stuff you didn’t know. And plus they have to live with a bunch of pain in the ass stuff that goes on with their body, the least we can do is to learn a bit about it and be thankful we don’t have to deal with it (I’m assuming you are a guy reading this, but I could be wrong).

Lots of chances for follow up questions to learn more, but yeah if it’s about bodily stuff you might not want to pry too much. But the good stuff about being a woman is great to ask questions about. You can also talk about what’s good about being a guy.

15. What random stranger has had the biggest impact on your life?

This is one that she’ll probably have to take some time to think about, because it’s not a common question. But it can be a lot of fun to answer and can be quite thought provoking as well. Plus, she’ll get to tell a story about her past and how it affects who she is today; which is always good to know.

To keep the conversation going; remember to ask more details about her story, ask about other random strangers that had an impact on her life, or tell her about a random stranger that had a big impact on your life.

16. What achievement are you proud of but most people would consider silly or weird?

This question is a great way to find out more about who she really is and what she finds interesting / fun. If the girl you are talking to is a girlfriend you might be able to use that info to create a game / competition that only you and she plays or it might turn out to be great for future gift ideas. However she answers this question, you’ll probably learn something new and interesting about her. Don’t forget to ask a lot about the details.

17. What period in history had the best fashion?

Not all girls are into fashion, but a fair number of them are. Even if she isn’t way into fashion, she still might like this question. It’s probably something she has an opinion on, but I can almost guarantee no one has ever asked her. To expand the conversation, you might want to ask about if different time periods were better for different genders.

18. What silly or funny thing makes you afraid or creeps you out?

This is a fun question that doesn’t quite delve into deep fears, but can still get strong reaction. You can talk about why the thing creeps her out and if she has any funny stories about the thing she is afraid of. You could also move the topic into more serious fears if you wanted to get a bit deeper. But feel free to keep it light and talk about humorous fears.

19. How quickly do you jump to conclusions about people?

This one is a great question to find out more about how she views other people and what stereotypes she has. To further the conversation, you can ask her about what she thought of you the first time she saw or met you. Or you can ask her about what the telltale signs for a good and bad person are.

20. How would the world change if super heroes and super villains actually existed?

This is a question to get the creative juices flowing and I’m sure you both can come up with some funny and interesting situations that would arise if super heroes / villains existed. Sure, the girl you are talking to might not be too into this question if they don’t like comics or watching super hero movies. But with how popular super hero movies are, it’s probably a safe bet she’ll enjoy this question. If she doesn’t like those types of movies though, you might want to give this one a pass.

21. What would be your strategy for surviving an apocalyptic epidemic?

Another one that is a bit off the wall, but I’m sure we’ve all thought about it. Especially with how popular post apocalyptic shows, movies, and books are. This one is an easy one to expand into a long conversation, because you can discuss the merits of each strategy compared with each scenario. I mean, there have literally been books written about this. So yeah, lots to talk about. Especially if you two are into the post apocalyptic genre.

22. What is the most important change that should be made to your country’s education system?

This one is a bit more serious. But you can see how much she is into social change and probably get a good idea of her political leanings. Or you might find that she doesn’t really care about it. Either way it’s good intel. You can easily expand this question by bouncing different ideas off of each other and talking about the merits of each idea.

23. What is something you think you will regret in the future not starting now and what is something you already regret not starting sooner?

Oh procrastination. Yep, we all do it. This will let you know how much she procrastinates as well as letting you know about what some of her goals are and what she finds important. Try not to nag her about her answers, because one, she probably already feels bad about it and two, you probably have stuff that you should’ve already started. If your goals line up, it’s a great way to get a conversation going about what you both would like to accomplish in the future. Also, it’s great opportunity to complain about how busy the present is.

24. If you could put your brain in a robot and live indefinitely, would you?

A couple of large philosophical questions wrapped up in a fun hypothetical question. You could talk about what makes a human a human. Or you could chat about the merits and drawbacks of living indefinitely. Or you could just talk about how cool it would be to have robot body decked out with lasers *pew* *pew*!

25. If you could replace the handshake as a greeting, what interesting new greeting would you replace it with?

This is a rather silly question, but it can be a lot of fun. Plus it’s doubly hilarious when you both try out different greetings. Try out secret hand shakes or high fives with elbows, you are only limited by your creativity.

26. Who’s the worst guest you’ve had in your house and what did they do?

This is usually good for a funny story. And she’ll enjoy it because it gives her the chance to break out one of her good stories. Encourage lots of details and ask lots of questions.

27. When does time pass fastest for you and when does it pass the slowest?

What does she enjoy and what bores her? If you don’t know, well now you’ll know! For follow up questions you can ask about more examples or you can prompt her with activities to see which ones she finds tedious and which ones make time fly by.

28. What always sounds like a good idea at the time but rarely is?

This is just a fun mental exercise in coming up with humorous / true examples. And I can almost guarantee there are some good stories about bad decisions to be had from both of you. See what you can come up with and see who has the craziest stories.

29. Are humans fundamentally different than animals? If so, what makes us different?

Whoa, what is this serious question doing here? Yep, be prepared for a conversation filled with landmines like religion and other strongly held beliefs. This question is not one to be busted out lightly, so pick the right time or just skip it. Nothing wrong with keeping a conversation light but I’ve always enjoyed a good deep conversation as well. So dive in or give it a pass, it’s up to you.

30. You can broadcast one sentence to every TV channel and radio in the world and have it translated to each country’s language. What sentence do you say?

A question that just begs for creativity. You can think of a lot of sentences that would have a lot of effects. You can take it in a more humorous direction, get serious with it, or a bit of both. However she wants to answer the question, remember to always ask why and find out more. Think of some more examples and try to think of what sentence would have the most impact or have the funniest outcome.

31. What fact are you really surprised that more people don’t know about?

Hey who doesn’t love learning new facts? Try to think of facts that the other person doesn’t know. You’ll learn something new and have some fun tidbits to talk about. Just remember to talk about each fact and not just fire off facts rapid fire.

32. What are you most passionate about and what do you wish you were more passionate about?

I love this question because it gets to the heart of who a person is or at least how they see themselves. You can see what actually interests her versus what person she wishes she could be. This one might even give you a glimpse into the direction she wants to take her life in.

33. What’s the best comeback you’ve ever heard?

A really fun and often funny question. Chances are she has a pretty good story about an amazing comeback. Plus, you can tell any comeback stories you know. I mean, who doesn’t like hearing about a great comeback?

34. Who haven’t you seen or talked to in a long time and hope they are doing okay?

Another question that delves a little into the past. Perfect for getting to know her a little better. Get ready for a little reminiscing. Sure it’s probably no one you know, but it’s someone who is or was important to her.

35. What’s something that you’ve never been able to do well?

Sharing faults and shortcomings can be a great way for two people to become closer. Just make sure to be supportive and don’t make fun of what she can’t do, that kind of ruins the point of the whole question.

36. Who is the most humble person you know?

Kind of a random question but it might give you some insight into the people she chooses to surround herself with or the people she looks up to.

37. What is the silliest reason someone you’ve known has completely lost it?

Another one of those questions for pulling out a good story. I’m sure you’ve got a funny story about someone losing it to share as well. Great for a laugh and for getting a conversation going.

38. What is quite possibly the most annoying thing ever?

We all get annoyed at things, now you can see what she finds annoying. Probably a good idea to try and avoid doing the things she finds annoying. And there’s a good chance that you’ll both share something that you find annoying and it’s always good finding things in common.

39. What’s the weirdest tradition your family has?

I’ve come to the belief that no family is totally normal. There are weird traditions and customs in every family. Often people don’t even know that other families do or don’t do a certain ritual or tradition.

That’s why this is a perfect question for finding out more about her family and how she grew up as well as sharing some about your family.

40. If you could choose anyone living or dead, who would you choose to lead our country?

Possibly political but this one will probably end up getting more of a creative answer. It can tell you a lot about what direction she’d like the country to head in or it might let you know that she isn’t into politics.

41. What app on your phone do you wish you used more?

A little different spin on the normal “what’s your favorite / most used app” question. We’ve all got apps on our phones (usually self-improvement / education apps) that we mean to start using but never get around to.

Also this question is a great gateway question for a discussion about apps.

42. Who was the most power mad person you’ve met?

Kind of an odd question, I debated whether to include it on this list. But it might lead to an interesting story, so I decided to leave it in.

Feel free to skip this one if you aren’t into it or don’t think she’ll find it interesting.

43. What world famous monument do you have no interest in visiting?

A pretty random question, but great for seeing what she isn’t into. It can definitely lead to some interesting answers and you’ll learn a lot more about how much she likes / dislikes travel.

44. What is something that you think people are only pretending to like or are deluding themselves into liking?

A perfect question for finding out what trends or fads she just doesn’t see the point in. Definitely not a normally asked question but it can get some really interesting answers.

45. What joke went way too far?

This one can get dark quick depending on what story she decides to tell. Just a heads up. Still a great question though and can lead to an interesting story.

46. What are some of the telltale signs that a guy is creepy?

So we all know people that seem a bit creepy. So, what mannerisms makes them seem creepy? Are they really creepy or just a little socially awkward? This can really lead to a great conversation about how humans view each other.

47. What is your very first memory?

A little question that probably won’t tell you much about her, but it’s still a fun question to answer. We all like talking about ourselves after all.

48. What’s the most embarrassing thing you’ve said or done around someone you had a crush on?

Get ready for some cringing. She might not want to let you know, but if she does it can be a really good question for bringing out a good story. You might want to skip this one if you just met her but it’s great if you’ve known her for a while.

49. Who is your favorite actor or actress?

Another question that is a little generic but perfect for learning what types of movies she is into. Also a great intro into a conversation if you also like one of the actors or actresses she mentions.

Plus, it’s easy to spin this question off into a discussion about movies. Because who doesn’t like movies?

50. What doesn’t exist but you desperately want / need it?

Perfect for some creative answers and blue sky brainstorming. It’s always fun imagining what form solutions to problems will take. Plus, you’ll both get to commiserate about problems currently without a solution.

PERSONAL QUESTIONS TO ASK A GIRL LIST

There should be enough questions to pick out a few gems that you want to ask. Just make sure to ask follow-up questions to fill out the conversation.

1. What is the strangest habit you have?

Everyone has some quirky things they do regularly. And while it’s not exactly a deep dark secret, it’s probably something that they haven’t admitted to a lot of people. Sharing small, slightly embarrassing things is a great way to build trust.

2. What movie made you cry the most?

With this question, you can see what types of things tug at her heartstrings and possibly how often she cries at movies. And if you’ve seen the same movie, you can talk about it, or if you haven’t, you can ask what she found so touching about it.

3. What is the most embarrassing thing you own?

Definitely a very personal question, but hey, you are on a page titled “Personal Questions to Ask a Girl.” I like this one because sharing embarrassing things we own or have done brings people closer together.

4. What do you hope you grow out of?

We all change as we get older. And we all have habits or quirks in our personality that we wish we could get rid of. With this question, you can find out what things she hopes to shed as she gets older.

5. What is the healthiest and unhealthiest thing you do regularly?

Health is a broad and subjective thing. She might focus on mental health, physical health, or even spiritual health. Perhaps a mix of all three. Whatever direction she chooses, it will tell you a lot about what she considers to be important to her overall health.

6. How much do you judge a person by their appearance?

There is a good chance you won’t get a totally honest answer to this question. No one likes to admit to being shallow, even though before talking to someone, looks are the only thing we have to make judgments about a person. But you never know, she might surprise you with a completely honest answer.

7. What was one of the happiest moments of your childhood?

Reminiscing about earlier days seems to be a popular pastime for most people, especially as you get older. But even if she is young, who doesn’t love reliving a beloved childhood memory?

8. What was the worst date that you’ve been on?

While everyone enjoys remembering the good old days, it can also be fun telling stories about dating disasters. Chances are that she has some good stories to share about dates that turned into train wrecks. You’ve probably got a few stories as well. It’s all part of the bittersweet process of dating.

9. What’s your favorite vacation memory from when you were a child?

More childhood memories? Sure, why not?! Talking about fond memories is a great way to foster a positive atmosphere. And what is more fun when you are a kid than vacations? Of course, if she talked about a vacation for the earlier childhood memory question, you might want to give this one a pass.

10. What belief do you have that most people disagree with?

So this one can go a little off the rails, especially if you strongly disagree with her belief. But if it’s a belief that you also share, it can lead to a great conversation. Even if you disagree strongly with the belief, at least it’s good to know that she has that belief.

11. What impression do you try to give when you first meet someone?

It’s rare for people to show their true selves to everyone they meet. As one comedian said, you aren’t meeting them, you are meeting their representative. So, what is her representative like? What kind of first impression does she strive for? Is it the same for everyone, or does it change based on who she is meeting?

12. Who or what inspires you to be a better person?

This is a great conversation starter because it’s easy to fall into a conversation about their heroes, their hopes and dreams, and who they want to be. It’s also perfect for finding out what she considers to be a “better” person. Because what a “better” person means is pretty subjective.

13. What’s the TLDR description of your last relationship?

Whether you want to ask this one or not depends a lot on the type of conversation you are trying to have. It’s definitely super personal and will probably send signals that you are interested in past relationships, which can be a touchy subject. So while it can be a great conversation question in the right setting, it can also be a conversation killer if you aren’t reading her signals.

14. If you found out your current life has been just a dream, would you choose to wake up? (You don’t know if your real life would be better or worse.)

Kind of like the Matrix, but possibly without the dystopian flare to it. Maybe they are just in a coma, and when they wake up, they’ll have a whole new life. But really what this question is shooting for is whether they like big changes and adventure or to play it safe. It might also spark off a conversation about how happy they are with their life as it stands.

15. What dumb thing did you believe for a really long time?

Another question that is meant to bring people closer through admitting embarrassing moments. Plus, it can also be good for a laugh. Try to have one of your own embarrassing things you believed ready after her answer so she can have a laugh at your expense as well.

16. What are some things you would like to achieve before you die?

The bucket list always makes for a fun conversation question because each item on the list can be a jumping-off point for a great conversation. Plus, you can share some of your own, and probably you’ll have quite a few in common.

17. Where would you like to retire?

Maybe someplace quiet in the country or perhaps someplace in the city with lots of things to do. You can also ask about what kinds of things she would like to do when she retires. Chances are they are things she would love to do these days but just can’t find the time.

18. What brings you the most joy in life?

So many ways this question can go, and all are usually pretty interesting and enlightening. It’s the perfect question for finding out what she loves most in this world. And it’s really easy to have a nice long conversation with this one because it’s something she is passionate about.

19. What is the best and worst part of your personality?

This question, if answered truthfully, will tell you a LOT about her. Just remember that even if she is completely frank and honest, these are the things that she perceives as the best and worst parts of her personality. We as humans often have a huge blind spot when it comes to our own personality and behavior. But it’s still very enlightening to hear what a person perceives as the worst and best parts of their personality.

20. When looking for a SO, what three things are most important (besides looks)?

What a person looks for in a SO tells you a lot about what they value in their relationships in general. It lets you know what values and character traits she values highest of all.

21. What is the most frightening thing you have ever done?

Handle this question with care. And make sure you let her know that you don’t mind skipping it. I say this because, while most of the time her answer will be something normal and will lead to a good conversation, it can also drag up traumatic memories. Just be aware that it’s possible asking this question might lead to some dark places.

6. What is the ugliest thing you own?

I think this a great “weird question to ask a girl”. Weird, but personal, without getting into the creepy weird territory. This will probably get you a good answer and don’t forget the follow up questions!

7. What ice-cream flavor is absolutely disgusting?

Sure you might have been asked what your favorite ice cream flavor is. But when was the last time you were asked what flavor is disgusting? And if you or her are at a loss for gross ice cream flavors, you can always Google it! There are some seriously gross flavors out there.

8. What food would be the best to make a house out of?

Okay so this question is definitely on the weird side. Like the witch in Hansel and Gretel, she’ll get to choose what food to make a house out of. See if she’ll go practical or delicious.

9. What do you dislike but have no good reason for disliking?

We all can be irrational at times, and so can she. So ask this question and find out what she dislikes for no good reason. Who knows, maybe you’ll share her distaste for it!

10. What are some things that you’ve never bought and will never buy?

This question has so many possible answers, from the mundane to the incredibly interesting. Whatever her answer, you are sure to learn something new about her!

11. Who’s your favorite protagonist from an animated movie?

Everyone has seen quite a few animated movies, even if they are only Disney movies. I’m sure she has a favorite hero or heroine and you probably do as well. Not incredibly weird but definitely not a run of the mill question.

12. What’s the worst you’ve seen someone screw up on social media?

Whether it’s a misguided friend or classmate or perhaps an older relative; there have been some serious screw ups and embarrassing stuff on social media. Now you can both have a laugh regaling each other with social media missteps.

13. What was the last thing that you remember that made you cringe?

So this one might be a little related to the last question because there is definitely some cringe worthy stuff on social media. But if you really want to cringe check out the [cringe subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cringe) and [cringepics subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/).

14. Who should’ve quit while they were ahead? (Can be someone in your life or someone in the public eye.)

We’ve all known that one person who went just went too far and now probably regrets it. I’m sure she does too. Whether she heard about it in the news, from a friend, or was there to witness the fall.

15. What is something about life that people don’t appreciate as much as they should?

This question is a bit deep, but we all suffer from a severe lack of appreciation and sometimes it’s good to be reminded of that. Plus, you’ll get to hear what small or underrated things she appreciates.

16. What’s the best “less is more” example you can come up with?

For this one the answer doesn’t have to be weird but it can be. This one is a bit random, but definitely requires some creativity and can be quite fun to answer.

17. What view would you most like to have out of your window?

This is another slightly unusual question but one that can lead to some really great answers. Find out what kind of scenery she likes, or perhaps she’ll take it in a more creative direction. Either way, it’s a great question to ask.

18. When was the last time you literally stopped to smell flowers?

So everyone has been told at some point to stop and smell the flowers. But when was the last time either of you actually did? Find out with this question. And if you both haven’t smelled flowers for a while, go find some!

19. What product has greatly exceeded your expectations?

Definitely an unusual question to ask and it almost sounds like some kind of survey. But there is a good chance you’ll find out about some ridiculously awesome thing you can buy.

20. If you could instantly know how to speak another language, what language would you choose to know?

Whether it’s for travel, business, or curiosity we all would probably like to know a different language. But it’s a lot of work. So find out what she would choose if there was no effort at all.

21. What was the strangest gift you’ve ever received?

Oh yeah, you’ll get a good story from this one. We’ve all gotten some weird gifts. And so has she. Now it’s time to hear about some of the strange things she’s gotten.

22. What’s the worst thing a person can do that isn’t illegal?

This is an odd question, in that the answer can be light and funny or get really serious. Either way it’s sure to spark a good conversation. Enjoy!

23. Where’s the weirdest place you’ve found something that you lost?

Who hasn’t put something in the refrigerator that wasn’t supposed to be there when they were dead tired. Now you can hear about what weird and embarrassing places she has left stuff.

25. What was the most uncomfortable thing you’ve had to do out of politeness?

So that is it for our weird questions to ask a girl. I really hope you enjoyed the list and found some great questions to ask. If you still need some more questions, we’ve got plenty of other questions you might like.

QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR GIRLFRIEND

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE

Looking for a long term relationship? These questions will help you get an rough idea of what direction your lives might be like if you continue dating.

1. Take minute, close your eyes and imagine what your perfect life would look like. Describe it in as much detail as possible.

This question and the one following it are great for finding out what she wants out of life and the life she would live if everything went perfectly. You can compare your girlfriend’s answer with your own goals for life and see if they match. So, if your perfect life is travelling around the world with nothing but a backpack and no cares, but her perfect life is building a business from the ground up; well, you two have some talking to do.

2. What would an average day in your perfect life look like? Do you have just one ideal life or can you think of more than one?

Also, even though they tell you a lot, they are still great lighthearted questions that you can bring up whenever.

3. What do you think the role of a woman in a relationship should be? How about the role of a man?

This one is very important to ask so that you can go into the relationship on the same page as far as roles go. If you both have wildly different ideas about both of your roles, you’ll need to get that settled before you get too far into the relationship.

4. Should roles change when a couple gets married or moves in together?

These two questions to ask your girlfriend are great for seeing how both of your roles in the relationship might change in the future, or at least how she is expecting them to change.

You’ll want to check your expectations against hers and see how they match up. If you are looking for a more traditional relationship situation and she is more progressive, I guarantee you’ll both be on the road for some serious fights.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PAST

The past has a lot of useful information for the present and the future. These questions will help you learn more about your girlfriend’s past relationships so you can learn more about your current relationship. Remember to pick the right time and the right place for serious talks about the past.

5. What was your most serious relationship? How long did it last? Why did it end? What did you like / dislike about him?

Okay, okay, don’t get jealous when she is talking about ex-boyfriends, you’ve got ex’s too. You don’t have to compare her ex’s to yourself. This is great info on what she likes in a relationship and what she doesn’t. Plus, it will tell you more about how she views serious relationships.

6. Have you ever cheated on someone before? What happened?

This one is a land mine so be careful. That being said, it’s a great bit of information to know. I may be wrong on this one, but I think there is a reason people say once a cheater always a cheater. Has she cheated on more than one boyfriend? Well there is a good chance she’ll cheat on you. Same goes for you. I don’t think the rule applies only for women.

7. How much time did you usually spend with ex-boyfriends? Did you think it was too much time, or not enough time? What did you usually do with your ex-boyfriends?

Okay, one more time. Seriously. No getting jealous over ex-boyfriends. Don’t be that guy.

This questions basically lets you know how much distance you should be giving her. Some guys like their girlfriend to be around all the time, and some don’t. Same with girls. Some girls like spending as much time with their boyfriend as they can and some prefer having some distance. It’s just a personal preference.

Just like most of the questions, if your answers match up that’s great. If not, well it’s something to keep in mind. Don’t smother her and don’t give her the cold shoulder.

We also have a page of topics that has [a section on personal history](https://conversationstartersworld.com/topics-to-talk-about/#personal_history).

QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

These questions are all about what she likes. You can keep these in mind to make her happy, or you can see how they compare with your likes and interests.

8: What are the three most annoying things a boyfriend can do? How about the three best things?

Things that annoy her = don’t do those things. Things she likes = try to do those things.

9. What was the most adventurous / crazy thing you have done in the past month? What is the most adventurous / crazy thing you have ever done?

This one will tell you how risk seeking or risk averse she is. If she is a lot more risk seeking than you, you might have to expand your comfort zone. If you are more risk seeking than her, be prepared for the fact she might not want to go with you on adventures. And she might not want you to do risky things either.

10. Do you prefer being outdoors or indoors?

Is she the indoor type and you’re not? Don’t expect her to enjoy being dragged out on camping trips. She the outdoor type and you’re not? Better get some hiking boots. If you are both really different, maybe try compromising and doing cabin trips.

11. What three objects that you own do you value most?

This one you’ll have to read a bit into. Is it something sentimental? She probably has a strong sentimental streak. Something practical? She probably isn’t very sentimental. Is it something expensive or something she can show off? Get ready to say goodbye to your money.

This one is also great because it’ll help you get some gift ideas for later. Or at least gift categories. Sentimental, get her something that reminds her of your relationship. Practical, give her something that will help with her hobbies. And so on…

12. What would you do if a close friend started saying mean things about you?

This question lets you know how she deals with conflict. Is she a peacemaker? Does she escalate things? Does she just avoid it?

Chances are she’ll deal with conflicts the same way with you. Maybe she’ll try to make peace, maybe she’ll get furious, maybe she’ll just stop talking to you.

13. What are your three favorite movies and three favorite TV shows? How about your three least favorite movies / TV shows?

This is a surprisingly practical question that will let you know how much you two will enjoy going to see movies together and watching shows together.

Does she watch shows / movies with you that are way out of line with her favorites? She might just be humoring you and watching them because you like them. If that’s the case, she’s probably going to get tired of humoring you and start wanting to watch what she actually likes.

14. What is your idea of a perfect Saturday night?

This one will let you know what she likes to do, perfect for getting [some date ideas](https://conversationstartersworld.com/date-ideas/). Sure she’ll probably do what you want to do for a few Saturday nights, but eventually, as the relationship continues; she is going to want to do what she wants to do. So if you like partying and she doesn’t, or if you like chilling and playing video games and she likes going out. Well, that’s going to be a problem.

QUESTIONS ABOUT SEX

If you are in a place in your relationship where you are comfortable talking about sex, then these are some great questions to learn more about who she is sexually. If your relationship hasn’t progressed that far, don’t worry about it, just skip these.

15. How many sexual partners have you had? Have you ever had unprotected sex?

Yep, these are some pretty basic questions to ask your girlfriend, but they are pretty crucial to know. She’ll want to know the same. Tit for tat.

And remember don’t get all pouty about her answers if she has had a lot of sexual partners or if she has had more than you. It’s not a competition. And besides you probably want a girlfriend that enjoys sex as much as you do.

On the flip side if she hasn’t had a lot of sexual partners it might mean she isn’t so into sex or it might mean she isn’t as experienced in the bedroom, or it might mean she doesn’t like to have sex until the relationship is a bit more serious.

Basically you want her sex drive to match yours, whether you are really into having frequent sex or if sex isn’t very important to you.

16. What two things would you like more of while having sex? Is there anything you’d like to try in the bedroom that you’ve been afraid to ask for?

A good sex life is important for a healthy relationship. You should both be trying to make each other happy in the bedroom. But don’t feel pressured to try something you aren’t comfortable with. And don’t pressure her into trying something she isn’t comfortable with. If either of you isn’t enjoying the sex you’re having, it will end badly for both of you.

17. How often do you like having sex?

This question will help you see how well both of your expectations about the frequency of sex match up. Usually if one person in a relationship has a vastly different number it’s a bad omen for the relationship. But you can try talking through it and trying to find some middle ground. Just don’t try and force the issue. You’ll just have to decide how important sex is for the relationship.

18. What time of day is the best for sex?

This one will give you a good idea of what time of the day she will most likely be in the mood. Good intel for sure.

QUESTIONS ABOUT MONEY

Ah money, the number one starter of fights in a relationship. These might not be the most exciting questions to ask your girlfriend, but they are seriously important.

19. How good are you with budgeting money?

At least one of you should be good with money. If you are both bad with money, one of you will need to work on your money management skills. And you should probably decide who if you are in a serious relationship or live together.

20. What do you think is worth spending extra on to get the best?

This question will let you know what type of stuff she’ll be spending money on in the future. It can also let you know what she values.

21. What do you think is a waste of money?

This one will tell you what she’ll get angry about if you spend money on it.

22. What is the best thing about money: it provides security, it allows you to create good memories, or it allows you to buy nice things?

This question will let you know if she is a saver, values experiences, or values objects. Do with that knowledge what you will.

23. In a relationship, when should a man pay for something, when should a woman pay something, and when should they split the cost?

This one is mostly for new relationships, but really good to know what kind of expectations are on the table.

So there we go, those are my questions to ask your girlfriend. Hopefully they’ll help you out and give you some good info about your relationship. Just remember, like I said before. None of these questions is a relationship sinker, just keep in mind what is most important for you in a relationship.

RED FLAGS TO WATCH OUT FOR

These are some really good things to keep an eye out for. Especially when you are just starting to date a girl. They are red flags that you’ll want to investigate a bit further before you get too serious.

Watch how she treats waiters and waitresses.

If she is mean to them she probably has a mean streak that will come out to bite you in the ass. The best way to judge a person’s kindness is how they act towards people they don’t need to be nice to. Plus, who wants spit in their food?

“I hate drama, but drama always finds me.”

Nope, she loves drama. And she probably goes out of her way to create or encourage it. Be prepared to always have some kind of drama emergency going on.

She hates your hobbies.

She won’t start liking them. You’ll either need to end it or stop doing the things you like. Find a girl who likes the same things you do. Or at the very least find a girl who tolerates your hobbies because she knows they are important to you.

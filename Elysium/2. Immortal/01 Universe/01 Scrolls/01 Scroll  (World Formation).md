# The giant-impact hypothesis, 
sometimes called the Big Splash, or the Theia Impact, **suggests that the Moon was formed from the ejecta of a collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized dwarf planet, approximately 4.5 billion years ago in the Hadean eon** (about 20 to 100 million years after the Solar System
1.  #Creation/World your world was born from the remnants of the collision between two celestial bodies, and the impact left a powerful magic that affects the world to this day. 
2. #Space-Time protagonist discovers a way to travel back in time to witness the moment when Theia collided with Earth
# Water from ice plannet and planetesimals
1. Planet collides or an meteor or something extraterrestial collides maybe as an result of terrorist attack is found to countain an NEW MINERAL, NEW MAGIC POWER, NEW METAL, SUPER RARE METAL #Conflict/War/Resource 
# Atmosphere CO2 to O2 through cyanobacteria, New Era began. Oxygen reacted with metals in Sea reacted form thick layer hard lock layer turning water blue
Water in those times filled with toxic level metals concentration, but with oxygen in air it reacted and stabilized.
Oxygen can’t remain in atmosphere for no reason on plannet there has to be GENERATING SOURCE CUZ O2 is FAST REACTING
1. An artifact/deity that will purify the seas or the lake or the river that was cursed by …  #Artifact  
2. A magic law about certain energy like For mana to be abundent there has to constant generating/converting source otherwise it will get exhausted since It’s very potent substance that get consumed easily by lot of things. #Magic 
3. Thick miasma there has to be source MYSTERY TRY TO SOLVE #Miasma 
4. Unintended consequence of using an artifact that BRINGS RAIN/ MAKES SOIL FERTILE/ PURIFY WATER #Artifact/T2-City  

# Increase O2 in beginning was lethal but slowly creatures adapted
1. An special of monsters, animals THAT ADAPTS QUICKLY to almost any enviroment. 
2. New species thtat meerges due to change in environment wheere all other species dies to the disaster #Creation/Evolution #timeline

2. Creature that devours plannet core to harness it’s powers #Creature/T7-SolarSystem 

# When atmosphere couldn’t protect from sunlight primitive life have to life underground in geysers
1. Some reason cause people can no longer use resources (Coal, magic core, etc) that they ones used to do their daily life.  NOW FORCE TO USE OTHER AND THEIR TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT HAS RREGRESSED SINCE THEIR OLD TECHNOLOGY IS NO LONGER OF ANY USE.EVERY SECTOR SHUTTING DOWN #Event/T5-Continent 


# Super strong tides in hadean ERA even lakes have significant ebbs

# Subducted continent plate descend towards core strengthening the geomagnetic field
Sacrificing or Self-Sacrifice a strong person OR whole continent of world To make shield for world or To strengthen sield of world
Or Just an immortal sink continent to increase strength and mana quality
#Conflict/T5-Continent 

# Core suddenly Solid 
If the core were to become solid, it would mean that the planet's magnetic field would disappear, as the magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the core. Leaving planet unprotected from solar winds and cosmic radiation, damage to electronic equipment, disruption of communication systems, and harm to living organisms.
#Event/T5-Continent  

# Core suddenly Gas
If the core were to become gas, the pressure and temperature of the planet's interior would decrease dramatically. This could cause the Earth's mantle to solidify, leading to a cessation of plate tectonics and the end of volcanic activity. The loss of volcanic activity could result in a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, which could eventually lead to global cooling and possibly even an ice age.
The sudden cessation of volcanic activity could also lead to mass extinctions, as many species would be unable to adapt to the new conditions.
#Event/T5-Continent  

# The loss magnetic field would leave living organisms exposed to harmful radiation, which could lead to genetic mutations and increased cancer rates. 
1. some entity in end destroy shield and its harmful effects appears, plagues spread and new type of monster slowly over time, while many dies

# Plucking Out Sun
Light and gravity of sun takes 8 minutes and 20 sec
where somebody just reaches in and
plucks the sun out and just watches what happened 
how we are in our blissful ignorance for eight minutes and 20 seconds you know what that's another great short film you show the beauty of life in real time of eight minutes and 20 seconds and only
you the viewer **knows** that *that*'s that's all over for everybody to end and by the way they
can't know that any sooner than when it's too late
> After an catastrophe event has already happened now effect will be visible in 5 minute, you have 5 min till effect reaches there that’s what our MC learns Then you switch scene show how other normal people living and flowing with life, full of hope, ambitions, dreams of future, oblivious that soon tragedy will befall upon them that they are oblivious and blind to. 
> AND THE WORLD THEY KNEW AND DREAM OF THEIR FUTURE WON’T EVER BE THE SAME AGAIN 
> Something terrible happens however the information reaches them x min later due to lag (like 8 min from sun to earth)

5. With plant eating - there is lot of testing before confirmation #Dilemma/T1-Village 

# LOT OF OLD SITE BUT DON’T KNOW WHICH TOO DUG,
YOU COULD HAVE WASTED ALL YOUR RESOURCES  AND NOTHING OF THAT MUCH VALUE OR BECOME FILTHY RICH.
People generally don’t explore random dungeon due to same reason but will visit time to time like lottery ticket
BUT WHICH DUNGEON SI ACCESSIBLE TO WHOM IS REGULATED A LOT BY
Politics, Danger, Geography, 
Degree Of Safety for Adventurers, inhabitants

a memory comes to my mind that happened in the ayush colony in teh back intersection area . =Ayush was telling akshat bhiya or parth bhiya that why he considered me his best friends. He said everyone used to make fun of him or tease him for having black skin colour but never once have I teased him about his colour.

I was overly sensitive as a child so that must be the reason, i never made fun of his colour, whenever i am trying to tease or make a joke.

It was the first compliment whichÂ  just stuck in my heart so deeply.. That's why I remember this incident which was occured about when we were in 1st 2nd class. 6-7yr old.

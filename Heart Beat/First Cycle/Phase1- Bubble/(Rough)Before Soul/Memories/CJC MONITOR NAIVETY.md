## CJC NAIVETY
That’s why i should never lie to anyone, help others and basically do good deeds and if i continue doing good deeds god will reward me.

I actually recall an incident of 1st class. It was the time when i was deeply worried or say deeply wanted. I wanted to become monitor. Monitors used to get a blue colour batch in CJC and they were called to stage and given the batch so i thought it is really cool. I wanted that, but monitor used to be students who were super good in studies and i used to study and work really hard in that age  without anyone bossing me to do it. But i guess the distance between them and me in subject knowledge was almost unbridgeable.

Well so continuing with the story. I used to always pray to god before sleeping or while trying to sleep that god please ‘make me monitor’ ‘please grant my wish. I will ask for nothing more ever in my life please make me monitor’

Then one day it happened. I don't remember the exact details of the day but i was punished for something. (Like i said i don't remember exactly everything is vague and foggy. I can only tell the key moments) but i was honest to mam and tell everything i did without lying since I used to be a morally upright person because I believed in god. 

Mam was impressed by my honesty and she made me monitor and actually somewhere i knew i was acting morally upright cuz its good and i will be rewarded for it cuz hat’s what i heard from the story.

I got to become a monitor. I was happy for few days but horror started.

As monitor its my duty to get keys from counter and attendence register and the counter was next to principle office. CJC was a super strict school and teachers used to often beat us for no reason. 

And i didnt had the monitor badge yet on top of that cuz mam told me that she will give me that later. 

I think i wanted that badge more than anything so i can boast to my friends and other but i didnt got that and that really disappointed me.

I was very very scared and everyday before sleeping i used tp pray to the same god that please take this monitor position away from me.

And god once again responded. My best friend Ayush, who was an ex-monitor, got the key for me but told me ‘i had to get key myself in future’ something like that.

But i was too scared to pull something scary like that myself so i did bring keys and register myself 1 day but most of the times i didnt and mam will scold me each day for not getyting key. I will apologize and say i forgot then before sleeping i will pray to god ‘please save me. I will ask for nothing more ever in my life please save me’ till i sleep.

And my call was heard once again and mam removed me from being monitor cuz i never did any of my duties rightly but for the time i was. I got to write name of kids and sometimes they used to get beaten and sometimes not. When mam dismissed me from being monitor i was overjoyed. Pheraps the most happy and light i have felt upto that moment cuz i still remember it. I felt like i was in air and from then i was so so greatful to god.

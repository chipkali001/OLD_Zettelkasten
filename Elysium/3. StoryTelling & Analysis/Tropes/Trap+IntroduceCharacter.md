“You’re sure Kaname Sudo is going to show up in Shibuya.?” Inukai received information about Sudo’s location from Rein Information analyst
When MC was idling waiting for Shuka, Inukai enters the scene, he steals MC phone and say MC to follow him if he wants his phone back. 
“You must be Kaname Sudo I presume?”
“Where are we going?”
“Just shut up and follow me.”
“You are too careless about the phone that has D-Game on it.” 

**We too can use similar ways to introduce character like instead of the character stealing an object important to MC. It can be a pet animal/monster or underling of character  or our character is shapeshifter, it will assume form of kid or animal steal the object, take the MC to backalley and reveral his true form or kill him then reveal his trueform
A new person who gained power is NAIVE & CARELSES with it’s use, danger, security**

Class 9th , sst sir was calling students one by one to speak answers. My turn came, i knew the answer but couldn’t speaking anything due to my low self-confidence, my pronunciation of some sound was poor and my english wa spoor on top of that. I just stood there and looked at Shubhakar. We both started laughing. I guess laughing was a good way to save my face. It created a light atmosphere in class, sir made some few jokes, But sir asked me to speak up. I just lowered my head and sir send me out of class and said he will hear question on next day my turn didn’t came next day, so the day after that my turn came, and i knew that laughing won’t help me now cuz environment was so serious so can just lower my head

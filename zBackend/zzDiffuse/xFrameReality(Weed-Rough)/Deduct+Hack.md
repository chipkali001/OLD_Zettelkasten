In the MBTI self-assessment, often some of us are faced with an intractable problem: how do you confirm which personality type you truly are? There are often confusions and mistypes, such as between INTP-INTJs, INFP-INFJs, etc..

One way is to look for what you absolutely cannot stand, even if you had infinite patience.

Each individual can have their own unique likes and dislikes. But I've come to the (unscientific) realization that, invariably, no one can tolerate any violation of their dominant function, irrespective of whether that person tolerates transgressions in any other function. Any infringement of their dominant function will result in quick, wholesale and irreversible demotion/rejection of the other person, whether said or unsaid, and all further concerns summarily dismissed without argument. Any imperfection or blemish perceived in their dominant function is considered not just a flaw, but a total failure.

As per the MBTI, there are a total of 8 functions, each with their own distinct characteristics. To know what your dominant function is, study and see which one of the below-mentioned set of behaviours you are least able to tolerate.

.

1.) Si-Dominants (people with Introverted Sensing as their dominant function):

-   Exclude/Avoid (on first impression):

-   Someone not part of their own clan or peer-group. Maybe, someone lacking status.
-   (Their identity and history is their supreme truth.)

-   Can't go with (during interview):

-   Someone lacking pedigree or established track-record.
-   Something unknown and unfamiliar, unless it has been tried and tested successfully in the past.
-   Any change or flexibility in their traditional way of doing things.
-   Risk.

-   Can't stand (during daily life):

-   Loss.
-   Someone lackadaisical with procedural/ritualistic minutiae.
-   Someone unmethodical, unsystematic, uninstitutional; too distractible, "a wandering eye".
-   A casual slacker without any sense of responsibility.
-   Someone’s inability to see the unchanging cycles of duties in the world.

-   Opposed to:

-   Someone with variable and shifting identities.

-   Internal sorting algorithm:

-   Sees only a non-negotiable binary about "Is this how it has always been or not?" No middle zone ("tertium non datur", as Jung would say).
-   Open, nuanced and negotiable about everything else.

-   What they are essentially saying is:

-   "I can't sacrifice my existing system for you."

.

> Fun Bonus: How to subtly mess with their minds?

> -   Lower their sense of prestige. Show off expensive items, or if you can't afford them, talk about someone else in possession of greater riches or position. They'll grow green with envy.
> -   Invite them to a whacky restaurant, and order the most foreign and unusual food available.
> -   Make plans and specifications, and then keep changing them midway. Bring on general chaos.

-   "I can't sacrifice my good life for you."

.

> Fun Bonus: How to subtly mess with their minds?

-   Can't stand (during daily life):

-   Someone lackadaisical with planning/strategizing depth.
-   Someone trying to lift their veil of secrecy; probing too much too soon, forcing them to divulge more information than they were prepared for, likely granting such a person a handle for future manipulation, resulting in a catastrophic loss of subversive control and bargaining power, and possibly compromising their carefully-planned maneuvers.
-   Someone disturbing their flow state; criticism, disagreements; someone too credulous, easily swayed by others' opinions; too flitting, "a wandering mind".
-   A dilettante without any sense of focus.
-   Someone’s inability to see the true unchanging nature of another person/thing.

-   Opposed to:

-   Someone with variable and shifting ideas and priorities.

-   Open, nuanced and negotiable about everything else.

-   What they are essentially saying is:

-   "I can't sacrifice my future plans for you."

.

> Fun Bonus: How to subtly mess with their minds?

> -   Be unpredictable, mix up your signals and responses.
> -   Make elaborate plans about a friendly gathering and then change the venue or timing at the last moment.
> -   Ask them for their opinion/advice, and when they're talking, interrupt them repeatedly every 10 seconds with diversionary "but-what-if..." scenarios. You can finally end it with, "that's not going to work for me", but do this only if you want to infuriate them further.
> -   Keep probing them about their personal motives and their plans, and pretend to not notice their visible discomfort.
> -   Catch their eye with a sharp piercing glance without any facial expression, and hold that look for 5 seconds. They will be thinking about it all day.

-   What they are essentially saying is:

-   "I can't sacrifice my wild fantasies for you."

.

> Fun Bonus: How to subtly mess with their minds?

> -   Answer everything they say with "I don't know", delivered in the most boring manner possible. "Hey, do you want to..." "I don't know" "What you think about..." "I don't know" "Do you think..." "I don't know" "What if..." "I don't know" "W..." "I don't know".
> -   Look thoroughly unenthusiastic about their proposal, blandly say "Are you really sure? That's a terrible idea...", and leave, without elaborating on it further. They will spend the entire day in doubt.
> -   Walk in on their discussions, drown out their ideas by dropping a reminder about some mundane earthly task like, "Forget all that… the broken corner chair has still not been repaired...," again delivered in the most boorish fashion (and get out before they start cursing at you loudly). Be a general kill-joy.

Officially, the answer ends here.

But knowing all this, how can you use this information and take advantage of it? I’ll provide an example below.

Imagine you are appearing for a job-interview (or a date). You do not know the person sitting opposite to you too well, leave alone knowing his/her MBTI type. And yet, you would like to impress him/her, but at the same time, you do not want to inadvertently trigger him/her in any way and diminish your chances on the path to gain that person's acceptance.

To make life a little more difficult, the MBTI functions don't play well with each other. Some functions are opposite to each other (Si vs Se, Ni vs Ne, etc.), some are antagonistic to each other (Fi vs Te, Ne vs Si, etc.), and some are blind to each other (Fi vs Ti, Ni vs Si, etc.). Hence, you cannot please everyone with one strategy. If you move too much in one direction to accommodate one of the types, you will end up antagonizing its opposite type. It's like walking on a tightrope.

What you can do, however, is to have a minimum set of common behaviours that will do just enough to evade being caught up in the negative cognitive zone of each type – a kind of a mental balancing act.

Here is a sample set of such behaviour:

1.) Dress well, groom yourself, polish your shoes, wear a wrist watch, and look sharp and confident. This will take care of the Se-Dominants.

2.) Arrive on schedule and in time. This will take care of the Te-Doms.

3.) Smile, greet the person or his/her team warmly, show appropriate manners, have a positive attitude, say all your 'Pleases and Thank-Yous', make necessary eye contact. Handle enquiries about your family and relationships seriously and gracefully. This will take care of the Fe-Doms.

4.) If you come from a prestigious institute or family bloodline, subtly highlight it. If you don't, then subtly oversell your institute's virtues and achievements right at the start, but keep it short (we're trying to be minimalistic, remember?). If you know someone or someplace close to the interviewer, subtly highlight it. If you have prior experience in the subject, briefly highlight it, unless asked to expand further. Carry necessary paperwork to prove your credibility and credentials. This will take care of the Si-Doms, and possibly the Ni-Doms, too.

5.) Talk briefly about who you are, where you come from, and where you'd like to be a few years from now – a rough roadmap of your life. Talk at a measured pace, don't hurry. This will take care of the Ni-Doms.

6.) Keep a list of your past achievements ready, with necessary paperwork, and demonstrate if asked. Show glimpses of seriousness and resolve. Even when not asked, you need to clearly and unabashedly display an ambitious nature and spell out your goals – make sure they're modest but materialistic, such as a certain salary figure, a specific rank or title in the organization, a house or a car, etc. (don't worry, everyone secretly admires a person who has an ambition in life). This will take care of the Te-Doms.

7.) Stick to talking only about those subjects you have a solid grasp of, at least initially; don't shoot from the hip. If you don't know about something, simply say, "I don't know", or "Regrettably, I do not know enough on the subject to form an opinion." Explain your points in a brief but logical buildup, unless told to expand further. This will take care of the Ti-Doms.

8.) Be open to new ways of doing something, even if you're not 100% sure. Sound cautiously optimistic about the future and agreeable to their ideas. This will take care of the Ne-Doms.

9.) Talk in a straightforward way, treat other people with respect and dignity, be humble. Promise to take everyone along during decision-making and being mindful of their needs. This will take care of the Fi-Doms.

10.) Don't overdo anything.

None of the above steps is likely to anger ANY type, and can be safely deployed against anyone. The interaction may sound boring and uneventful, but it allows a future development into the position without any shock first-stage elimination.

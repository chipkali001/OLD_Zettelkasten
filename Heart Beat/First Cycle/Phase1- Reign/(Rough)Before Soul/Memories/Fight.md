# Taekowndo Begin
It is tale of probably 5th class, our school sd zero period where kids used to go in different sports. I tried football and other and finally i somehow ended up in taekonodo. One of the reason i joined taekowodo was i wanted to defeat saransh bhiya who was my neighbour in a fight. He was one year older than me and i couldnt defeat him in fight, you know it was easy for me to fight and defeat any kid of my class causey height ws above average and i was fat and i held pride in that and i only had two-three strategies that i used to use in all fight. that in beginning of fight i will take big distance between me and the other person then i will take fighting stance and try to provoke other person. Now on those times all knowledge of fighting everyone has from tv and cartoon . So they will usually try to run and punch, they will think since i am so fat that if they run and attack they can easily beat me but now when you try to run and punch your center of mass is sso unstable that punch won't have much strength to it and i have nothing to fear, and my height was usually more so for their punch to reach my face will be too offangle. So when they will try to rin and attack me i will rpetend that i am trying punch or kick him and in a fighting stance just he is few meters from i will use my front leg with full strength and hit his ankles and now when momentum of running person and my leg combine y created big impulse so the pain they will feel will bring them to their knees in pain and even if they aren't holding knee in pain. The pain will be big enough that they will loose ability to make sense, respond anything i do, so i will go forward grab his neck and continously hit his back and use my weight to make him lie down and now i told i was fat so my weight was usually 1.3-1.5x than the erson i am fighting so they will eventually be lying on floor and if they fight back too much i will hit then on the leg i initially attacked until they will be on their backs now usually fight happened in colony or school so in social situation there was matter of izzat so even after they are on ground they will try to get back up and figut so i will just kick them on their stomach or just stand on their legs with as low surface area i can do i can exeet more pressure. The moment i am exerting pressure they will just scream and don't resist but once i lift my leg some will gain try to get back up and i found that very admirive and i knew that until i have completely crushed their ego and fighting spirit and make him fear me. He will try to take revenge in indirect ways .

So after enought hitting on legs i will go the face and put my shoe in thier mouth or on their mouth ki 'chaat' . They resist i again kick in gut and put my shoe on face and they will give after 2-3 cycle. I will have to be alert for whole day that they will not attack me from back or come with their friend group to beat me up.

But since saransh bhiya was 1yr above me. I didn't have height advantage and i was pussycat, i didn't have that natural aggression, or that much anger. I can get anger for maybe few 10-15 second and after that i will feel funny for feeling angry so i didn't have that fighting spirit that he possessed r the people who i had to put shoes on face to make them give up. If i am not completly sure that i will win a fight so i will just say sorryw en don't pick a fight.

One time i beay  maybe it was devrath or whoever it was, after u beat him i thew away his shoes and then usse ghasit ke uski class main wapas feka.

Ek baar mouth pr shoes rkhr roka tha.

Normally i school fights. Even though i was too much of a coward.

I was even scared in attacking that i don't injeure soemone really bad

( kickint.on gut more.of an sharp damage(hitting on vitals), attack on neck or crotch, eye, nose these are more of an sharp damage but these can lead to bad things,so my aim always blunt damage, licking hitting on leg) I never had to worry about loosing cause i was one of the tallest kid and i had fatty too. And maybe because of that many times 

i fought the other person used to believe because i am fat & big they are more phsycisally fit and do taekonodo or whatever they can easily best me up but that's not how things actually work. 

The taekowodo and the one they watch from movies were stupid.

In taekoeondo, they will do, spin hokar marna aur whatever but they are stupid, in the first page if i have more weight and little height than you then your kick won't be able to throw me off 

THERE WAS ZERO ADVANTAGE TO HIS TAEKWONDO.’

I WAS 10-15Kg heavier 

I JUST HAVE TO PROTECT MY HEAD AND CROTECH.

I CAN TAKE REST KICKS HEAD-ON.

IF MY FOOTING IS STRONG, I WOULDN’T REALLY STAGGER THAT MUCH.

AND ONCE I HAVE CLOSED IN GRASP OPPONENT.

It’s Grappling situation and even without fiormal training i used to have lot of fights with my little brothers SO I HAD MORE EXPERIENCE OF GRAPPLING SITUATION.

And me being heavier I have natural advantages.

so i only have to make sure that he dont hit me have at head or crotch and maybe if i am lucky, i can elbow his kick, just a little momentum from elbow when they connect with kick then their knees will hurt so badly that they wont be able to stand but even if recieve few kicks they can only manage to do one or two kicks before i grab them by their neck, and after that all kicks are useless.

In games or movie inspired fight what happens is one person run towards the other and then attacks

As long as i protect my face and crotch they can't deliver a punch that's strong enough that i will cause me to deter.

I jaut have to walk up and just push him down using my whole body weight and cause i was easily 15-20 kg more than them in weight. It doesn't require any skill. And in case push daily i hsve to just hit his leg agian and again until gives in isut a little and then i can push them on gorudn and once they are ground they have already lost since i just kick them in hit or put my shoe on their face or crotch.

—---

Also most kids were inspired from the movies watched whennfightjng they somehow believed that if they will run and then punch then it will be super strong but that's stupid you need a stable footing to deliver right punch cause you try to put some your weight into it.

But my always strategy was to take a defensive stance and act like i will try to fend off their punch but that was just a facade. When it was last moment i will just kick them on knees and I didn't even require too much momentum + i was tall do my legs had more range before their small hand have chance of reaching em my legs can easily intercept them and i don't need to even have too much moemntum in kick but caus rthey were running before so sometimes i hit them when thier leg id in air so it had lesser impact but most of them time impact was strong enough that they will just hold their leg and flinch in pain and even if they don't i will put my around their  neck and will use my hole body weight to jump and push them and if that didn't work i will just continuously slam them on back without stopping until they stagger a little and will push them down.

Ombe they are down and if they still want to fight cause w lot of guys have big ego so they just can accept defeat. I will kick them in stomach. Noe i have to be delicate with them otherwise it might turn into a serious problem so i couldn't just kick them all out cause kick on gut is bad) is more.and if they are still resisting then my my method was to stand on one of their leg and just stand on them 

I realized self defence from taekoeondonis zero cuz in taekwondo all tge fights happen in ring where you have full mobility and ability to move where you wish but in classes there are bech everywhere and surrounding objects you can pickup use. Second i think goal of taekowodo is to win taekoeodo completion not fight in real life. I mean you can figh

can't standup to them and belike 
Papa ko call krdo sir unke samne maar ke dikhana
Bdi class Mai to phir tum kr skto ha na ki Mai class see bahar chla jaunga haath mt lag dena.
You can puff up your crst and look into his eyes with telling i will hit you back of your dare to touch me.
I was really meek so teacher may see that as me feeling guilty and punish me. 
I won't have courage to stand up for myself so
i moved closer to him but

In small classes there were few guys who had an spirit of or hold pride in "i am the one who is more physically powerful than you and i can defeat you in a fight" but the opening for fight rarely arise because my mom has told me you shouldn't fight and words of my mother were like words given by some holy scripture that i have adhere to all times and becaus ei was mumma's boy (mummy ka aacha baacha)(good boy) so it was rare occasion where things escalated into fight most of the times for substitute we will do arm wrestling.

In school when teacher goes away we will do Panja ladana (arm wrestling) to see who is the strongest and it was really fun because many times i will be on edge after we are holding a position for 10-15 minute. Like i am strong and i am not tired trying to pretend like that in hope that other person will give up and many times they did but somethimes teacher will come in.

Devrath tanuj fight in school

My fighting strategy stand still in stance when other person is walking oro running towards you then act like you are going to punchand at last moment hit the front foot on the joint or area below that, bcoz their own momentum is turend against them, the person will collapse grabbiing his leg and if he doesnt collapse then grab the person by neck, make him bend then start hitting strongly on his back and try to make that  person collapse on ground. Once he/she is on ground either run away or keep beating him on face, stomach, chest so person cant stand.

Act like you are furious and intimidate  the other person otherwise he/she may try to get a revenge.

ONE TIME JUST OUT OF NOWHERE, i got an urge for mischeif, i cant explain why? but i decided to hie bag of ashish (Who was kind of leader of kids who were deliquent like) in zero period,

I hid his bag inside the mam’s desk and covered it with some chart paper that was  present in the desk. I thought when everyone go away, he becomes worried. I will reveal that I hid it under the desk.

So i went downstairs to play and now we had to come back after 0 period to get our diary sign and then to home, on may way back home, one of my frien HARSH stopped me and asked ‘tumne bag chupaya tha?’
I think i told convinving lie but Kunal saw it too and he was with me and kunal stayed silent, he wasnt really good at instant lie mmaybe his face gave it away or didnt?
I asked him what happened?

Ashish was worried  and was searching for his bag. English Mam came and she was telling us something or taking attendance, special class for kids bad in study. 
Suddenly music starated playing from mam’s drawer.

Whole class started making noise.

Mam found his bag and phone.

Mam kept his phone with her.

I never told anyone I was thet one who hid the bag. 

Next day mam was laughing, asking him password and was saying she wanted to listen to songs too.

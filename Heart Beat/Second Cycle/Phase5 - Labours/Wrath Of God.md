# First Wrath Of God
> [!Error] Bahubali cracking open & lifting SHIVLING, placing it under WATERFALL


First task would be to bring him the **skin of an invulnerable lion**

Cave which had two entrances, Hercules blocked one of the doorways, then approached the fierce lion through the other. Grasping the lion in his mighty arms, and ignoring its powerful claws, he held it tightly until ==he'd choked it to death.==

Many times we can identify Hercules in ancient Greek vase paintings or sculptures simply because he is ==**depicted wearing a lion skin**==

> 9. Revision Chunk System & USE **==LOOM==**
> 10. CREATE STREAM system based on ==religion imagery== you'll create to CATEOGRISE & ALLOCATE time. You needn't do TYPING daily to increase speed. JUst maybe 1time week or .. SO YOU MUST have an ALTERNATE ACTIVITY in that timespot in other 6 Days. MAYBE one day is Monday do image vocab Sunday do word vocab

The second labor of Hercules was to kill the Lernean Hydra
A monstrous serpent with nine heads, the hydra attacked with poisonous venom, One of nine heads was immortal and therefore indestructible.

- First, Hercules lured the coily creature from the safety of its den by shooting flaming arrows at it.
- Each time Hercules bashed one of the hydra's heads, Iolaus held a torch to the headless tendons of the neck. The flames prevented the growth of replacement heads
- Once he had removed and destroyed the eight mortal heads, Hercules chopped off the ninth, immortal head.
==- Hercules slit open the corpse and dipped his arrows in the venomous blood==

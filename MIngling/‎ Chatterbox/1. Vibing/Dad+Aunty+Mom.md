**Talk about her mom in romantic way. DEVRATH WORKS! CONOR WORKS!**
TALK AUNTY IN FLOW, YOUR OWN FLOW, DONT CARE ABOUT OTHER, FOLLOW OWN TONE, There is no need to care about akwardness since they all are NPCs.

So aunty for setting boundary when you really can't tolerate, they may just want to have fun and you may fend them off.
Use aunty and makeup to makefun

Make aunty out of chimp who thinks they can get away with saying anything.

Auntiyo see unke game mein kaise jiit skte hon?

Auntiyo ko lgta hi hai ki saari baate unke baare mein hi ho rhi hain.
Kaisi dimag hoga Jo aaisa soch skta hai.

Tumhe auntiyo see panga nhi Lena chahiye, unse jitna artful chugalkhor kuch nhi hota 

Don't or never directly call them aunty but always do it implicitly.
Ex say - just namaste, aap in tone 

Aunty 
Uncle
Mummy
...?
Kya hua 
Koi nhi agar sharam aati hai uncle hi bol lo. 
.
(Say in tum from now on not aap)
.
.
.
.
Xyz still silent
- koi baat hain? Idhar dekho 
.
.
- me to tumpr gussa nhi hunga papa wali baat see idhar dekho.
agar wo papa wali baat hai preshan mat ho to preshan Mt hon me tumhe daatunga nhi, mujhse drne ki zaroorat nhi
.
.
Chlo agar muskurogi to maar krdunga
.
(Then rise up and go somewhere else. This leaving is super important for attraction.)

.
Abhi bhi convinced nhi ho?
Thik ha tumhe Mai maaf krdunga agar tum "( ask her to continue what she was doing, if she was staring downwards keep  )"
.
Maaf krdiya 
.
Now wait till she returns to normal expression.
. 
Abto muskura do abto maaf krdiya . Tum mushkurate hue hi pyaari lgti hon
.
Meri aankho mei dekho, kya problem hai? Kisi ldke ne cheed diya 
.
Mere samne tumhe koi aur preshan nhi karega. Mere alawa.
.
If she says her boyfriend. 
Ask her yourself if she has boyfriend.
.
Oh Mera damad.
Agar koi problem ho uske saath mujhe batana 
-mere jitna koi tumhara dhyaan nhi rahega 
Tum khush ho?


After telling aunty namaste story say
Aunty makes sure people remian in line and behave themselves

When CX fumens due to aunty
Oh sorry I forgot to say namate
Ask your friend and say namaste kr

Meri mummy see shikayat mt Krna.


Cx- Bhai
Reply- han Didi. (Stay in regal demeanor)
Didi apne mujhe rakhi nhi bandhi? AP didi see aunty bnne Mai bhot busy ho 

Didi aap ko bhot time see nhi dekha aap ki rakhi nhi aayi
AUNTYIYA RAKHI NHI BANDHTI

Tumhe role play aacha lgta hai? Mujhe nhi pta tha

Mujhe tumhari is side ke baare me nhi pta thaa

Mujhe Bhai wala role play pasand hai actually.

You know Mera ek dost apni gf see Bhaiya bulwana pasand krta tha

I didn't knew tumhare aaise inclinations hai

If  cx friend cy look at your way and moves her head sideways to not dare to call her aunty.
Kiski side ho?
Auntiya jhund mei ghumti hain to side choose kro?
Tumne un 'mohtarma' ko namaste Kiya? 
Tumhare sanskar mujhe aache nhi LG rhe? Haina CX aunty?
Apne dost ko akela chod dena.


Sorry? (Make CX say sorry)
Sorry



Agrim's theory of aunty

AKELI AUNTY JHUND WALI AUNTY SEE JAYDA DANGEROUS HAIN


Didi
Oh didi aap mee apko pehchan bhi paya mujhe laga yha pr koi aunty baithi thi 
Aap badal gyi hon

Ek baar 2-3 auntiya thi,
Un auntiyo ka naam thaa 
Aunty "..(modify their names or call their surnames).."
Aunty "..(modify name).."
.
To auntiya ek shaam ek kiti party mein gyi.
Auntx was sitting next to aunty
Auntyz was sitting.
.
Ek dusre kee saath kuch samay aunty-talk krne kee baad.
Unka topic shift hua
Kon sbse jayda makeup lagata hai unmese
*Cough cough*
Aage continue kru?
Sorry bolo.
Look at CX and say "so first auntyx nee.." 
Pyaar see
"Aapka bf gussa ho jayga, aage usne aapka chahra dekha"
Make all say 
"Mujhe lga koi gussa hone ke liye nhi hain?"

"Kya hua koi pasand nhi aaya?"
Future main change hone ke chances Hain?"

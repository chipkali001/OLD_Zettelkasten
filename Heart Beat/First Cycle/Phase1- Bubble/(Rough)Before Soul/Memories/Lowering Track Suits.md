Lowering track suit in lunch, we will gang corner one person hold his hands and lower his pant and exposed them in underwear or theirbutt to general populance 

During winters we had tracksuits, so whenever there was wednesday or saturday or someone came in tracksuit cuz they didn't have original dresses or whatever.

Someone can pull your pants down and embarrass you so you have to be careful.

So one time, my best friend Arpan was standing b/w two rows in the front and i was just sitting in the back. I saw this opportunity. I was at the back so I called out to my classmate who was in the front bench. ‘Vipin!’ he looked back and I signalled him (finger point from vipin to arpan and pull hand downwards sign).

So he from where he was sitting grabbed his pants and pulled down and coincidentally what he dragged down was not only his pants but his underwear too, thankful he was only able to pull one side only cause he was sitting down.

The place me and arpan used to sit the backest seat. On the right side(sign, wave hands to show) was place where his crush was and she saw it too and was laughing and her friends were laughing too.

He was super embarrassed, he first started beating vipin, vipin said it was me so i got up and ran. The two of us played kho-kho.

I didn’t wanted to give him the relief from shame by beating me but in the end, the two of us sit together, so I had to compromise.

After sometime it became a trend, also trend of putting jacket on one person and beating him. But our fun was interrupted little when mam will be in class during lunch.

In front of mam, you can’t run and do everything quickly. These pranks were all about speed, you have to run attack quickly and escape. Presence of mam didn’t allowed that.

In front of archana mam, we have to live in bhaichara aur pre, see rehna anniwarya tha to.

Aur hum sb bhi aggya kari shishy hone ke naute uska aadar samman krte thee.

To agar hme ko mitr mam ki shalli kee ass pass dikhta tha

Show them region if mam is sitting here, then which area around.

So two-three-four-five of us will get up together.

Go to him and hug him to locks his arms and stop him from resisting. We will say mera bhai.

If mam will look at us we will start saying mera bhai with more love “Mera bhai~”

Mam will smile for some time before diving back into her work and we will use this opportunity to plunge his pants down or beat him.

Many times we will even push people int that zone and do it.

It was a different thrill doing in front of mam.

Sometimes mam will too see everything but she never scolded us harshly or punished us. Her scolding were only out of obligatory which is expected.

In  those cases, if someone is standing in proximity to space drawn by gate and mam.

WE DID IT WITH ALL OF GROUP.

They tried but failed, they all were lean and i used to go to gym and was bigger so they lacked manpower & skill to hold me

# Bees-Jamun Tree
One day while we were playing cricket there was a jamun tree( whenever it used to ripe we always used to throw stones to break them and catch them and then collect them in our plastic  polythene). There was a honey hive and one day during a six in cricket a ball directly hit the nest of honey bee and it feel down.

We freaked out  and all of ous laid down on ground (One time in my school some seniors broke honey bee nest and we had to lay down on ground so i remember what to do) spoon the sky was filled with bees we covered our face and neck by pulling up our shirt.

One bhiya who was biggest crouched ran and he opened door of dm house for us and we ran with full speed and locked the door. The door was actually a  jali wala door after few 20 minutes we realised we should escape to our house fast so we ran back.

# Cricket obsession childhood
On stupid thing did in childhood.

I got an bug of cricket so i decided i will make 1000 run without wicket.

I actually got bowled lot of time but i just push time saying that doesn't count.

And it wasn't like there was any one enemy team player who i was paying against.

I will just ask anyone to throw the ball for me. I have memory i was playing on the entrance gate of gao (village home) . I closed the door and was using the stick that is used to beat clothes to wash them in village as my bat.

I even played in midafternoon]

I cheated with count too and lied to self that wonâ€™t count.

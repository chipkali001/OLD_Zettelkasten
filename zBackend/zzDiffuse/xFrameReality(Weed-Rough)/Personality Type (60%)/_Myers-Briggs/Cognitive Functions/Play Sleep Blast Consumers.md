<font color="#f79646">WHAT MATTERS HERE IS THE ORDER OF PRIORITY ON THIS Consumers blaster sleep play. **WHAT IS HIEARCHY**</font>
& to intuit others hiearchy be like they aren’t blast last, they arent sleep last. OR they are strong about play or blast


**Consume** **I E** = Se/Ne+Ti/Fi = EPs & IPs = they are lead consumers - gathering experience/object/book-reading. Overconsume /undercommnicate. Over gatherinfo & concepts wont tell anyone about.
Learning, taking in more, respecting info, filling
**Blasters** **E I** =Ni/Si + Te/Fe = they take in less & spew/talk out more. Talking for 1 hour on one thing you read for 3min=Overcommnicate/underconsume. YOU FEEL THIS WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE oh god this oncept/book/idea is amaxzing, i got to tell sally about this.
Teaching, ontrolling, bragging, getting started
**Sleep** **I I** =Si/Ni+Ti/Fi Preserving enrgy, proessing, introspetive
**Play E E** = Expending energy, work, doing, showing off

**Cycles - Sleep <—> Play      Consumes<-- >Blasters**

<font color="#4bacc6">***JUMPERS who in SAVIOR/HERO state use their 1st & 3rd function***</font>

**Play** Non-standard **EXXP & EXXJ** - Supersmart but **leaves you hanging, wont do**
PRIORTISE expend energy for others (external world) than themselves (Internal world)
*Play last* - i am not gonna innite with them, if it takes more than 10 minutes then i am not going, i will not help uz i odnt really want to, lack of responsiblity to engage with external world.
AIN’T GOT TIME FOR BULLSHIT
(If they expend energy it has to fit inside where there sleep is, where ther consume is, where there is to teach, very very known to preserve energy.
If doesnt fit their box they will get drained quickly)
DEEP RICH INNER WORLD so they have double-activated sleep
They try to limit & PUSH BREAKS.
*Well i came here to talk these 3 ideas, i dont have time for rest BYE~ BYE~ Lets discuss them tommorow WHEN I SCHEDULE.
I entered this club to get XYZ now since i have it, club isn’t needed. I will see you when (next season come)/(terrains change)*
They leave others like WAIT you just came here.
*THEY PUT BREAK*
**Blast** **(IXXJ EXXJ)** - Leaves you **hanging (wont talk)**
ORGANISE THINGS FIRST
Ni-Te - okay here is the info, how does it work for me.
*Blast Last* in priority are like - nah i dont want it right now, will do it late, keep on delaying organisation, panic when deadline approach, little pressure to getting things moving & they dont communicate or get ball rolling.
**Consume** **(IXXP EXXP)**- Wont take in new (for self)
Know for self then blast it out for tribe. they want more information, idea, expereine, WANT TO DO THINGS FOR SELF & do things that benifits them personally THEY WILL ORGANISE it later FOR THE WORLD  
*Consume last*- take in relevant pieces of information then tehy are like I AM GOOD. I HAVE ENOUGH TO GO WHERE I AM GOING, I had enough, i dont want more stuff it feels like waste of time, I can figure out on my own. I dont want more stuff 
**Sleep** JUMPERS **(IXXJ IXXP)** - Wont take a break (for self)
They always know what they want, it’s organising & preserving energy just for self ALL RELEVANT THINGS. They are aware of things then need to be better at - even if they dont want to talk/share it with other people.
Best at narrating as it relate to self.
High state of personal awareness & in general aware of their own needs.
Priorities action for self vs doing for someone else
*Sleep Last* - they are just go go go. keep going & roll through they sometimes dont know what is really really important to them, think out process in real time because they havent proessed it internally & harder time prserving energy for preserving for self.

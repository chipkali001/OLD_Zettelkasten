On first day of stanford, 

From Class) to CLassIV. I was lucky that i remained in my section only (i.e Section A) Mant of my others friend’s sections changed but mine remained same.. I used to think A is my lucky number cause of it. I saw the people who go in section other than A as peasants.

When it was my first day in stanford. Just after getting off from the bus. I was super scared and when i was making my way to my class. I felt like i will forget the path i have to take to get back t o school bus and will get lost. So i just used to look for people who are in same bus (we used to have each bus name as root 10 or route 10 ours was route 10)/ It was a white coloured bus with AC. It was amazing. Ours was the only special bus in the school. No other had AC though minivan had. 

I asked a teacher about where to go to reach my class. 

Now i didnt knew if my section was sectionA or section B

First I entered Class 5A cuz i thought since it was my lucky number. 

Section A classroom was clean, the desk were super nice looking  i felt like i am in some high class place. In CJC desk were trodden and they were just two wooden slabs.

The new school desks also had a place below the desk where you can keep stuff. I thought it was so cool. ( i was a child so you know the amount of excitement kids have towards  new things right. I thought that i am going to boast to all my friends about this)

There was board on back on which there was name of kids who got position maybe memenant from old PTM)

I sat down. Placed my bag on ground next to desk but then a girl in class who was near in area where i was sitting ( i dont remeber but it was close proximity area), point me out that i should keep bag on chair and i was so embarrassed by it cause i felt what will they think of me as? I am a wild animal?  

But mam entered classroom everyone stood up and said good morning mam

But when mam started taking attendance or maybe asked my name. My name wasn't in the register so mam sent me to Section B.

When I entered class. This class wasnt that much good looking, the colour of benches and chair didnt have that polish that previous class had, but the chairs in class had a cuison. Which was comfy, super comfy compared to those wodden benches of CJC) 

[But i liked the old classroom more cause it looked better and i was kind of disappointed.  I have always been in section A but now i have to go in section B]

 I sat in the seat backwards cause I was kind of embarrassed and felt like I was in the backseat. I will remain hidden. 

Mam then did reshuffling and made me sit with Rajat.

Also there was something special only for the new kids. Maybe they did pooja and tilak lga rhe thee ( i dont remember exactly) but a new kid just like me was there too. He was a tall, fair and handsome kid.I felt like since we were in same situation. Maybe we first aksed each other from where you are. (The two of us became close friends and we sat with each other for long time but it was later event) (Mam encouraged us to sit together or maybe we ewrer sitting together and mam allowed it)

In stanford everything academic felt super easy. It was due to shift from ICSE to CBSE.) (Question Answers were short, language too was easy. Everything felt like a child play) ( Whenever mam asked a question. I tried answering, in the beginning i was shy, hesitant to speak up, but mam praised my answers in class so that made me feel nice. (I have already read the (science, maths) book of my class)

Suyash and I used to sit together in beginning but later i began to sit with harsh bhiya ( he used to bring smartphone in school, so i thought of him as a really cool guy) ( When certain level of people from bus got off, he will open phone and i remember he had a game unicorn dash (much later when i got axis to little mobile data(Internet was expensive so you can sue it in limited amount) in mom phone samasung white coloured. I downloaded it and used to enjoy it.

Now in that time, the first/second friend that i made was somya (extremely extroverted, bold, talkative, high in openness (creative) too, chubby , she was the girl that used to top classes before , (We called her nickname SUMO)). 

Apparently we were from the same bus, same class, she learned more about me from the sister of ajay bhiya who was a tenant of one of my friends in CJC. I don't know what he told everyone about me but it was all nice thing from what it felt like. She will tell

(So in 5th class we had rivalry but she started falling behind in studies, i dont know why. But rivalry faded away till  6th class nearly)

She used to come up and talk to me. She was the first female friend i ever made so it felt weird. I was a reserved type of person so i had a big, thick outer boundary that i dont like anyone trampling on. And the attitude that time i used to had towards girls was they are disgusting (But it was fake disgust) (why? I don't know)  (I remember telling saransh and sanjay bhaiya that i will never marry in my life. I remember two of them laughing a little cause the puberty was yet to hit me)

I felt uncomfortable. I thought she was little annoying cause she was too much talkative and so full of energy. I tried putting myself in places where she will not come and talk to me.

I moved my bus sitting seat from the orignal place to on the back seat of bus where there was harsh bhiya. 

But she was unrelenting, she came and asked harsh bhiya to sit somewhere else and harsh bhiya was looking at me and grinning. (I only thought to mysself No!! I dont want him to misunderstand) (What if kids in class began to call our names together?? No?? Hjust stay away from me.) (My brother used to give me a grin, some of my school friends too) 

I was desperately trying to push her away but i was shy and conflict-averse person so all my atttacks were indirect.

Soon i became mean to her and used to tease her cause she was fat. She was playful person so she will tease me back but one day she started crying from my teasing ( i felt so much guilt, my being mean was to push her away, my intention were not of hurting her).  I didnt say anything for few days but teasing battle continued again. She became little distant from me but still not too much distance

She even slapped me at 3-4 instances it was a combo slap. Her nails were big so they leftt unseeable scratches whcih hurted a lot).

Also in Stanford there was zero period in which we used to play games daily 

In haryana extra special attention to sports. I also remember complaining to somy acountless times about in cjc tehy never took us out fro sport even once in class 4th and even before they will always do those boring PE exercise which took so muc hof the game period. I also remember telljing her that kids in CJC are some sentient alien intelligence. Even after so much effort i can nver even compete with them. In stanford i came first in first term even without [utting so much effort. [I didnt spent ttoo much effort cuz earlier i r3emmber working soo hard in CJC desperately to get in top10 but it yielded absolutelty no results at all so i stopped trying cause i dont want to be disappointed.      

But i was so supreised when i got to knew i am first in class on term 1 (and that by a big margin) (I mean i was happy with top10 but jump to rank 1 without much effort.) It felt amazing but also a little discontent cuz i later realize other than 4-5 kids, no one even take study seriously so obviosuly i have to land soemwhere in top 5.

But after getting rank 1 became really popular in class. (Before FA1 exam, i got some popularity cuz i was close with somya and she was the most ppoluar girl in class and even in whole school a lot of people knew her, plus answering question in class, i was big/tall compared  to my other classmates so that gave me certain advantage in sport but still i was fat… but the sudden popularity felt really nice, i felt like i was somebody, my soul always have craved for that recogniton but i realized that need only when i got it)       

Our class teacher of 5th class is still to this day my favourite teacher. I remeber when i started crying and refused to partake in dance, mam said that she will not talk to me nor will any other kid in class. It felt nice somebody cared about me that much but my friends still talked to me      

I also had teacher monika mam (science teacher). Me and kundal used to go to her for olympiad prepration we will ask mam cquestion and mam told us that we can come to her in zero period to ask doubt)  [in class 6th rudra and me used to skip boring festivals/ by staying with mam qand studying, it felt nice] 

—--------------------------------------

CJC (Christu joyti convent high school) was strict and rigid.  But this open, warm, friendly enviroment and All these new elements, dimension i was introduced to, made my 5th class on of the most enjoyable year. It was like, i a person who can obly see in monchrome was seeing colours for first them. IT was no longer the dull world.

 But things started crashing down slowly slowly after class 5th but flames got restored in 8th. After death of ayush's father from heart attack butr wahat was after that was one of most amazing year of my life. (I felt like when ayush was in school with me, i have to adhere to the certain image he have me in hsi mind. I was trying to be that person and couldnt open mysdself up complelty but with him gone the persona was no longert needed and it was the year that i was the most me with all my friends, before that i always used to play the person but bnow it was just me and not persona.

 inonce again but i had to leave Stanford after 8th class.

Arpan wwas really close to rudra in beginning

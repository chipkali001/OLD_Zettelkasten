Tags: #School So my school was in sonipat Haryana and i used to come from a small city it was not even tier4. Village and citty ka bich mein.

So most students who came to our school were from haryana and a bus full of kids from baghpat. Baghpat didnt have much good school , so my mom dad wanted me to go to school which was faraway from home and it took long time to get there.

So if i had to be in robotics, i can't cause my father will have to come himself to pick me up and the distance was so far that aana jaana daily is too much of trouble  but thankfully a sir used to daily come and beside from him there were 2-3 big bhiya who are in robotics so meri setting baith gyi thi. 

But one day two bhiya weremt there in robotics so i felt 

'oh no! How will I go home.' but at that time i was in 6th class only and i don't know how to deal with such fear so i pushed the fear in my mind by saying to myself somehow everything will be okay. God will save me. I had lot of faith in God in childhood so it helped to supress my fear. But i just became restless i thought i should go check if my bus hasn't left yet but the bus left few minutes ago. 

No! I was more scared but i used god to maintain hope.

Internally i didn't knew what i would do and i was internally so freaked out but i went back to place where we do nevertheless and.i was little late to arrive that day. 

Now there was my friend rudra who was on of teacher ,(Monika mam) and Monika mam held a hugh post she was coordinator if i right remeber. 

I thought maybe i will ask rudra to ask Monika mam to call my father and he will pick Me up.

And the two bade bche jinke saath main jaata tha unki Monika mam teacher thi aur wo ache dost type ke thee sir from association rudra knew two bhiya and was good friend with them.

He came to me and told me 

Why are you here? Xyz and abc bhiya have gone to alphabeta today. How will you go home

He said that in really arrogant tone like

'You shouldn't be here today.'

My ego's first response was 

'who are you to tell me what i should and shouldn't do?'

'Ii said it's not okay i will just ask Monika mam to call my father and ask him to come pick me up like it's not big deal'

I was trying to act laid-back.

He then said to me 

'msm kyu tumhare liye call krengi?'

For some reason, i didn't understand he held type of arrogance and demenaing attitude specially towards me but we were still friend.

I again turn to scared mode. 

 I didnt have enough courage to go to mam and ask her myself i was painfully shy, also i dony know where to find her. I couldn't even ask my robotics mam too cuz i was scared and shy there too. 

At this rate what will happen of me.

I somehow managed to supress my fear and sadness throughout. 

Then time for going came.

Robotics ended. 

My two more friends harsh and Aman were except rudra and mrudra were there in robotics too so we played together in ground and on jhula that was empty. Harsh and Aman had to weight for teachers to come out cuz they went in bus in which teacher who went overtime go home. Slowly they left me and i wanted to cry. There was only rudra and me . He was again and again asking me 

'how will You go home?'

I was just diverting topic cuz i can't begin to cry in front of him. 

'Then finally rudra mom. Mam came

Mam on the instant of seeing me asked me 

Didn't you went home early today?

I didn't rember exact conversation but mam t

Told me bhiya and sir who i used to go with has gone to event and they will come back school in 1-2 hrs so i can go with them then. Also i should call mom to let her know.

I called mom. And mam talked to her and told her that …..1-2hr…. Then mam gave me phone to talk again

'I was scared and i wanted to say to mom to send father now i couldn't wait for 45min-1hour hr i am scared but that will be kind of rude and mam just told me what to do. So i just said i will be okay and don't worry.

But it was okay i was feeling really hopeful from not knowing what will happen of me now and after talking to mom i felt less scared .

Mam told me

Not to get scared, i can always talk to mom on reception of something have to say, and when i get back home inform her.

It was the first time i felt someone had acted so considerate towards my feeling so i felt so moved.

And for me mam became a god kind of figure.

Mam went away and after 5-10 minutes I of my happiness i again became scared   what if they forget about me and just drive past. Mam didn't call them. 

I again felt like wanting to cry . I wondered should i go to reception to call my mom agian.

No 15-20 minutes have passed . It will be wrong to call instantly after. 

Cause even if i didn't have words to describe why it will be weird to call her after 15-20 minutes later but deep within intuitively i understood that it would make mam appear irresponsible in front of mom and mam helped me so much.

It will be kind of like betrayal maybe so i shouldn't.

I was growing more desperate and more on edge of crying.

Time was passing slowly in that moment. 

Finally I just couldn't take everyone in. I went to the outside school door to wait there so that when they come they don't accidentally leave me behind. 

Slwoly slwoly bus and few van were coming back after dropping off teachers.

When i will check All those buses and van were empty.

I will from time to time go in front of highway to peak if the bus/van of stanford is coming.

Oh no! Maybe i have tbeen left behind. 

I decided that if within next 5 minute noone comes then i  will call.

But they came in van/mini_bus type .

I felt so relieved and happy.

Bhiya asked me

Tu kya kr rha hai 

But i was just too happy and relieved .

In my childhood I had a friend arpit. We used to play pretend play games in which the two of us use to become superhero, power ranger, mix everything.. Me blue rnager he red ranger. Sometime  spiderman 1 spider man 2 kabhi iron many and we used to creat our own story. We use to act out characters kick punch each other slowly of course.  I love spiderman and was huge fan of spiderman in those days. We will get into character and play like we both are real deal. 

"Arpit tum mar nhi sakte" " me tumhara badla lunga"

We used to say dialogues that we subconsciously learned form cartoon movies.

We will swing wood branches in air at each other, we will even play roles of more than one character at same time, sometimes, throw stones. When his health will be close to coming to an end. I will go to him and bring helaing medicine (which used to leaves of tusli and other plants). 

Sometimes after defeating the main boss  i get critically wounded, and on verge of dying, MAKE HIM FIRSDT LIE ON CHOKI 

WE WILL GIVE THEM CHEST COMPRESSION, MAKE THEM EAT JADIBUTTI MADE from TULSI LEAVES AND OTHERS COMBINED.

cause i used my whole power to deat the monster, so in that case i used to pretend to play dead by lying on chooki. He will come to me and press his hands on my chest to revive me like you see in movie.

whatever games or movie or cartoon wwe watched we will together add eleemtns from that into our imaginary story, create more richer storyline.

WE WILL SAY DRAMATIC DIALOGUES.

Now there was my other friend ayush too, we used to sometimes drag into our game, at times he will be resistant and act in implicit way to show what you’re doing is childish but we will somehow pull him in and make him play.

One day I and we was outside in front of his house. I was crouching on the non vegetativee garden and preparing plan of our story by scribbling on it on ground with fingers or stone.

So I was spouting mnogranth jo ham us din khelne ko soch rhe thee.  

Suddenly he froze and didn't speak for many minutes until he finally uttered words

“Agrim Bandar”

In the time I got to react and got on my feet to standing position from crouching a monkey was sitting on my head and shoulder and I froze.

After few more seconds or minutes he slowly started walking towards the door of his house and suddenly i mustered courage broke my paralysis.

I dont know why I did this but I threw the  monkey down from my head with full force.

He fell down then turned towards me and did his ‘’khiiiii’’ and showed  his teeth meri phat gayi but in that moment arpit screamed and ran towards door of his house with full force.

Monkey heard his scream and  jumped on toop of him bit him and scratched  him.

Later he had to get many injections

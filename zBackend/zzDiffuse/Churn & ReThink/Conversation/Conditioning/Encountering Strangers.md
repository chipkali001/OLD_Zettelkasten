Be in flirty mood, not the temporary fsmile mood when you see someone face after long time so you both giggle. That is only on surface level and fade in few second., Be in deep undertone flirty mood.

You can trigger it by imaging some flirty situation or just arpans cringe line 

Aur style bhai

A  'Namaste' while up downing your head a little 

If there is akward silence then giggle little stop. Goggle more stop, trn start laughing together.

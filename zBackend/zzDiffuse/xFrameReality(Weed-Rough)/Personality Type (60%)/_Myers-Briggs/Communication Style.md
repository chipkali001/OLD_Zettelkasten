# ESTX ENXJ - DICS
DICS (Direct initiating Control GROUP) - Incharge type- structure oriented , Man of few words,
TAKE CHARGE OF GROUP
You say what you mean & you mean what you say, DIRECT.
If they are talking a lot —> they arent direct, not even remotely EJs
ESTP - Triple Direct, exist to test structure, if it dont fit their standards, break every rule, they tear it down and build new one, when building finish they work with ESTJ for administation
If you are initiating then you arent responding
No problem initiating conversation with stranger.
Can see informative language as trial of manipulation
Control (Control vs Movement)
Takes his time 
If things start moving really quick they fall on their butt.
Mess with structure type - start making descions faster than they can imagine
Start without their input.
So they can’t handle.

ENTJ - number/system oriented, richest in history, greedy of all types.
You can convince ENTJ & ESTJ by SHOWING NUMBERS, actually almost any MBTI, excpet those who lack RATIONAL INFJ

Informative, Intiatin, Movement
Dont like people come too them it throws them off & have to think & force us into shadow personality.
Dont wait for peopple to come to them
Man of many words
‘Things they say always arent what they mean’
ENTP - cyptic label sometimes - too indirect (SVirtue vice - sincerity vs Incinerity)
Constant movement (Cant sit straight, playing with)
Movement is all about progress- satisfied with progress dont care milestone or reaching it. SJs & Controlling MILESTONES.
Lack of progress leads to INSANITY.
Movement types INJECT CHAOS to bring new life, so it’s worth moving again.
Chaos left uncontrolled too time is bad. Small chaos is GOOD.
THEY ALMOST NEVER FINISH until it’s SUPER DUPER IMPORTANT

RESPONDING, (not less outgoing, maybe inferior function not devlop enough to play game properly) 
LIABLE TO NOT TALKING TO ANYONE UNTIL SOMEONE TALKS TO THEM.
In group if they dont tlak, keep them informed about all, keep them in loop (even if it feels extra effort & not useful/worth-it)
Progress & Movement oriented
Inject chaos for work.
If try to finish but inhibit by someone they will withdraw completly or jump to conclusions or due to not getting movement once was.
THEY NEED MOVEMENT OTHERWISE THEY WILL GO CRAZY.
even MOVEMENT type needs STRUCTURE otherwise NO PROGRESS

# BEHIND SCENE ISFX INXP 
Shadowy individual, never upfront
Informative, responding, movement
Like when people come to them
Prolong social interaction strains them
For ISFP coffee can put them in ESFJ shadown and can become life of party for short time.
ISFJ can wow some people with one-one conversation.
GO AT YOUR OWN PACE, NOT IN HURRY, DONT LIKE FORCED TO HURRY
Social control big deal & system control is helpful
If ISFP, INFP get lethargic, ‘why bother? if i cant control’ if perceive lack of control, why put in any effort.
If their Fi hero miserable, it makes all other people miserable too and it spreads like VIRUS.
If ISFP when they have control over destiny & freedom then they can spend lot of time being precise with their art. delivering best experience with their work
BECOME SO CRYPTIC difficult comprehending.
Fi Hero, Te (inferior) - insecure about what people thinks, insecure about rules, afraid of too much structure, or structure is against them BUT THEY JUST COMPLAIN through HINTS get mad at you for not reading their hints. YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL.
ALWAYS RESPECT THEM. ALLOW THEM TO LIVE. DONT EXPOSE THEM.
If they share things to you, not with others, YOU’RE SPECIAL, you have special relationship with them. They’ll hate you & feel disrespect if you talk about their things in public & feel unloved. They will hold it against you.
Be careful, allow them to be as private as possible.
Si critic REMEMBERS ALL BAD.
Measure their mood.
INPs get so comfortable that they get stuck in ruts
Way to get INPs to work is call them out & make them uncomfortable, pull them out of shadow and expose them, they only know pain.
ISFPs maybe okay with their spouse leaving them alone for days so they can focu on their art, art is everything to them.
ISFP - Freedom
REST COMFORT ZONE

INTP - people arent so much important, life is puzzle to them, like to do puzzles
INFP - all about daydreaming, daydreaming
ISFJ- leave and go home, place far far away to get mental energy back
ISFP - finding opportunity to go back to their art


# TO BE GOOD WITH EVERYONE IN CONVERSATIONS, YOU HAVE TO PLAY PRETEND


TRY BE AWARE OF LANGUAGE NORMAL FOLKS AROUND YOU SPEAK
**ST** - Facts how all work, instructuon manual language, clear precise
**SF**- Feeling & Judgement behind facts of them/other people, not how it works but feel, language to write/critique reviews of a movie, whats happening at Bollywood
**NT** - Looking beyind fact & peering into Meaning & Jump ahead in future, pattern predict, phiolosophy talk in thise, what are pattern and how they work.
**NF** - Talking about emotions in abstract way, how people feel, see things, least useful way of talking, Theology and religion are kind of this language, How do we feel good? how to reach place we all like, It’s difficult to give good examples. least useful way of talking & difficult to give good examples that make logical sense

Job interview should be given in NT & ST language
Talking to GF - In lover language


# Hear argument First, Dont judge - it doesnt matter, first hear argument & adress it.

XNFs & XSXJs REALLY REALLY QUICK TO JUDGE. ESPECIALLY NFPs & STJs WITHOUT LOOKING AT ARGUMENT.

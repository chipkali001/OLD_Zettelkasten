I think you know anime is something light-hearted and allows you to forget real world stuff.
You can enjoy simple pleasures of life .
It's a feeling that 



Tell why you like anime without berating webseries but just simply stating  which pleasure you look for in anime and can only get from there. It's not better but unique & special.

I don't think i will enjoy anime when watching with friends but i will when i am alone.
Webseries and that stuff is suited for a group setting whereas anime i think is best enjoyed alone.

There is different type of pleasures in webseries and anime.
I like anime because while watching it you can go get the real world it's 
Webseries are entertaining and exciting, for emotion it can make you feel, i acknowledge all it i am not pushing it out but it isn't dreamy , i want something to stir my imagination.
I watch or like stuff which makes me wish i was there in that world 

And its just different mediums too just pike
Photography and art just captures different things they aren't the same.

It just fulfils the desire of something beyond that earth just can't contin. It needn't be better than earth but just non-earthly


When you say you prefer webseries over anime. 
For conversation -
 it sounds absurd.  
I don't they are same things that you can even compare.
It's like saying you like cocoa more than pizza. 
Both are different.
Eaten at different times at different ocassion.
Both stands on different axis.
It's also absurd if you stop drinking any beverage just because you don't like taste of coco cola, there are lot more of different taste soup, milk, wine....
And even in cocacola==aerated drinks there is lot of variety.
(Now also write an logical and philosophical answer without use of analogy)

ACTUALLY IN THE BEGINNING EARTH WAS CO2 blob humans didn’t do new thing, O2 was superlow.

It was cyanobacteria that evolved.

Increased O2 in atmosphere.

And in those time SEA WAS MAYBE RED-BROWN COLOUR FILLED WITH IRON SO IT WASN’T HABITATBLE FOR PRESETNT DAY LIFEFORM ATLEAST.

But they increase O2 so so much that O2 oxidsied iron in sea and turned ocean blue.

BUT IT KILLED A LOT OTHER BEINGS WHICH FEED OF CO2 and that type of enviornment

It's possible that your difficulty understanding speech in certain situations may be related to your attention and focus rather than your actual hearing ability. If you find that you have a tendency to withdraw or tune out in certain situations, it may be more difficult for you to process spoken language.

One technique that may be helpful is to practice active listening. This means consciously focusing your attention on the speaker and making an effort to understand what they're saying. You can do this by making eye contact with the speaker, nodding or using other nonverbal cues to show that you're listening, and asking questions or repeating back what you've heard to ensure that you've understood correctly.

HOW MANY PEOPLE IN PAST, CRUSHING ISOLATION FEEL DUE TO DISEASE CASTED OUT OF SOCIETY.

BODY PUNISH BRAIN SO BADLY FOR BEING CAST AWAY

  

Key to playfulness confidence- 

1.  is to be here, yet not be here, have something else occupy & possess your mind, thought of something else, don’t mind the meager stuff you see and encounter stay with something else, something better, maybe a novel, a thought, a poem. Something more serene and beautiful.
    
2.  This all is just transaction game (Barter System). Just a game, a lie, Everyone plays on themselves and others.
    

Interaction with everyone - Mom, Dad, each individual friend, each individual teacher/proffessor, each individual stranger.

WHY NOT MAKE YOUR ONLY CONTRACTED ONE YOURSELF. Don’t give anyonbe contract to your soul, ONLY SURFACE.

When talking or discussing something. ALWAYS

  

Remeber at lower potential you felt like you have even forgotten  how to be happy, something has gone terribly wrong and you would never be bale to be happy ever again.

  

Every reaktionship/bond is TRANSACTION. but now you can either see all transaction as unholy or all transaction as holy.

  
  

MOTIVATION/DESIRE/VALUES

-To stand up for myself, piku, in front of a group.

TO stand alone in front of a group and say KYA PROBLEM HAI. 

You need strength, big body, and INTIMIDATION.

Not for ego flaunting, whenever get the chance, with some niobody,

But when i see it’s necessary for me to  stand up

-It wasn't me who was weak, but the values i was taught was so weak, and so much wuwu

-Ant me chude tum, wo nhi

  
  
  
  

You follow rules/DynamicsFriendshipsNorms for the service you get in return from insititution/Bonds. If instiutions/DynamicsFriendships aren't serving you, then why follow the rules? 

YOU IMPOSE & FORCE YOUR WILL. 

You tear a hole in fabric, you make a step outside of chessboard.

DON’T BE COMPLACENT.

English vs maths which is more hard. DIFFICULTY IS STUPID but maths and programming are kind of unifacted where english has so much more dimensions to it AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE AT LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING & EXPERIENCE TO EVEN SEE SOMETHING IS THERE MUCH LESS APPRECIATE WHAT IT IS. It's not like maths where everything is clearly laid out step by step. 

No but in maths programming path, maethods to use are defined and laid out in english you carve your own way following an initution

That's true, in programming and math, there are often well-defined rules and procedures to follow to arrive at a correct solution. However, in English, there is often a degree of subjectivity and interpretation involved. While there are certainly rules of grammar and structure to follow, there is also a lot of nuance and creativity involved in effectively communicating a message. Additionally, understanding and appreciating literature, poetry, and other forms of written expression requires a level of cultural and historical knowledge that may not be required in math or programming. So, while both subjects have their own unique challenges, they do require different skill sets and ways of thinking.

I understand what you are saying. In math and programming, the methods and steps to solve a problem are clearly defined and laid out. However, in English, one must often rely on intuition and a deep understanding of language and culture to interpret and convey meaning. It can be difficult to know if you are making progress or wasting time in your study of English, as progress may not be as easily measurable as it is in math and programming. The nuances and subtleties of English can take time and practice to fully understand and appreciate.

Yes it's like realisations of what you thought of world as child and what you learn later. Without actually seeing anything you don't see anything in english. IN MATHS A DOGAM HAS BEEN LAID OUT WHICH FI YOU FOLLOW WITH DILLGENCE WILL ALWAYS BE AT YOUR BACK whearas IN ENGLISH YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE PROGRESSING OR MAYBE WASTING TIME/ DEGRADING.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Pollution and animal population dwindling.

I understand but I think humans limit copopulation is good, but i won’t stop and lower my rate.

And it feels childish to think feeding 8billion people won’t kill animals.  
It’s foolish.

WHY DO WE SEE HUMANS AS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT NATURE and ANIMALS ARE WEAK, FRAGILE WORK OF NATURE?

What do you thin kwill happen if there were 8billion tigers or lions or leopards?

Will they not kill lot of animals too?

So obviously humans does it too and it’s inevitable.

Yes we CAN AND SHOULD TRY TO MINIMISE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT.

But I don't think the jungle or animal kingdom works on KINDNESS, EMPATHY AND LOVE.

Rudra, i coined his nickname diaper, Pampers, manypokopants.

Diaper(say diaper not rudra)  was kid of a teacher mam who had high position,

She held position in results decision of competitions in school and organisation little too. Plus senior science teacher.

(No bad raport, don't say, they will project qualities you say onto you.

His personality was like his petname, like an 2 year old who thinks he owns, the world, high narcissism and kind of entitlement.

Try to make stroy fun, skim out unfluent protion)

  

 when he said bdsk kon hai? Or something like that.

Now his personality and voice didn't have that roughness so i used to cringe whenever he tries to be like he was in this type of attitude, i didn't even knew the word cringe then.

But he started to laugh. And i laughed both at different things.

Heavy voice.

I got down on floor.

And started tightening screws robots and dismantling little.

I wasn't scared actually wanted to see what will happen to rudra. 

He says in such a motherly way

Agrim aap aaise nhi, yee kro

Sir asked us to show how robit runs.

  
  
  

(#breaks flow

Knowing his character he will put the blame on me if he had opportunity to, so i was really alert.

I say down and i actually wasn't that scared cuz i deep inside knew that 

For sir i am just random kid xyz and he is rudra. 

He is the protagonist of scene, i am a bystander.)

  

Don't tell this to others cause this will harm innocence 

Piku well how should I

 explain this.

You see i think there are two emotions that is felt by female.

Like there is gloomy feeling, cherry feeling, anxious feeling,

Similar to all those it's a feeling and it's a strong passie force over the will.

Like in cherry mood and anxious mood you will perceive a situation, think about future, your past memories and every thing you depend on whether your emotional state is Anxious.

Don't confuse it with love, i think love is something hing male and female feels same type but 

These passiveforce are mor exclusive more to male.

Passive seeing where wife/lover/gf

1.  Meaing related 
    
2.  Lust/ visual related
    

Meaning related one is what will enchance the feeling of wanting to take care, protect you,  and do anything 

BUt it's not do anything in serving & wanting to please way,

but more in terms of protecting, even if you have to die.

And by dying i mean it literally, 

not in romantic poetic wuwu just an innate drive that will make you ready to die if needed.

Makes you feel territorial and possessive.

Normally when you hear possessiveness, a toxic and negative view point, that's a sign of insecurity.

But thats oversimplification i feel it's core resides in protection.

If let's say i have watch that's special to me , maybe a special gift keepsake i hold dare, i will care 

who dares to touch my watch. Is it safe? It will not get damaged.

I will always try my best to be attentive and it's stems from protective core, but from behaviour can be judge as insecure.

But but but you can be secure about watch but then it's more like

Who cares if it gets stolen or broken,

You can always buy a new one, there are infinite watch in market.

  

So someone can be 

Secure (but what is the core of the security, you must not forget. But you can chill)

–

Insecure/Protective (because soemthing precious that you can't just give up, even if you have to suffer pathetically)

Reason why it's precious  vary person to person.

  
  

My favourite type of trope or novels i should say a

Are fansty fiction novel in medivialish setting.

Romance novels. But romance but it shouldn't be too dramatic. 

male character lead is cunning/clever man.

Female lead is someonr of high social standing, and older than mc.

How to properly say, one line CLIMAX build, then spew details.

  

StartingLine - Ek baar school mei mon ho rha tha aur mei hasne lga.

  

Mere class me  wale do pradniyo ke baare mei batana hai jinka yha pr mei bsne wale do pradniyo ke baare mei batana hai jinka yha pr jo janwar involved hai.

  

Phele Janwar jo mera mitr mere bgl mei baaitha tha uska naam, shubhankar tha, wo bhot funny tha, saare teacher usse daate the pr psnd bhi krte thee.

  

Aur dusra pradni jo hmqari seat ke piche baitha tha uska naam kartikey tha, aur usske baare mei abhi bss yee jn lo ki wo MUJHE BHOT HATE krta tha.

ISKE PICHE LMBI DAASTAN HAI, agaar wo jaana hai thodi deer baad me bta dunga. Abhi story continue krta hu, bss yhi jaana important hai

Actually bhot reason thee sayad uske hate kee badle pr one of the pillars, yee thaa ki mene dushmani uttarne kee liye uske best-friend ko poch kiya hai.

  
  

ACTUALLY STORY THODI PERSONAL HEI MEI SO IT DOESN’T FEEL RIGHT TO TALK LOUDLY IN GROUP.

Dekho jb mein school mei naya aay tha 9th class mein, to mujhe bhot time tk koi apni biradri kaa nhi mila, jinka saath baaaitha tha wo bhot normal see thee.

Pr class mei do bche thee shubhankar aur kartikey jo best-friend thee, wo class mei sbko hasate thee aur funny personality thii.

To mei jo beghar tha, mei apni bsti whi pr bsana chahta tha.

Meri dosti hui un dono se.

Me ussamy 11th and 12th ki Physics Maths kr rha tha, aur wo dono bhi class12th kee baad engineering IIT karna chahte thee, Pr unme wo passion, energy nhi tha.

PR mei to hmesa see godly ambitious rha hun, 9th mei, mei khali 3-4 hours sota tha aur padhai mein hi. 

1.  shubhanakr mst mooula aur bhot charming personality thii tha to usme utni seriousness, competitiveness, uski soul mei nhi thii mene sbse phele usse. Mujhe pta tha ki mei usse convert nhi kr paunga
    
2.    Kartikey i was able to pass some ambition 
    

He was actually biologically hypercompetitive, ambitious, attentive and intelligent but he never got the environment to push him into his natural order but i was able to give little push into what his natural arrangement should be. 

He too was somewhat like me working day and night

We two became really good friend and will talk a lot about everything physics, maths, PHILOSOPHY, SPIRITUALITY (Hmme see kisiko aaise philosophy and spirituality words nhi pta thee, so were just talking about OUR EXPERIENCE AND FEELING TOWARDS - Sense of destiny, the order of the world, the concept of god, Just our feeling and experience NOONE READ BOOK OR ANYTHING KNOW what this is called.

  

Well shubhankar his old best-friend, wasn’t that ambitionful so he wanted him too to join us, class 11th 12th pdhna aur yee sb discuss.

He wanted to include him.

AND HIS WAY OF MOTIVATING HIM AND PUSHING HIM TO DO ALL THIS WAS BERATING HIM,

I dont remember words but essence was 

Ki tum chuttiye ho, tumhara kuch nhi hoga.

Tumhe yee bhi nhi aata.

In hope his ego will get hurt and he will work, but he was pure creature. UNLIKE ME and kartikey who were PowerHungry jo ek dusre ko maar kaat skte hei, apni power show krne kee liye. HE HAD GENTLE HEART. 

So he didn’t took all that in a positive way, and KARTIKEY had tendency to self-induldge in making fun of fim bearing him and 

THAT”s Maybe expected from someone who had that rough personality so he didn’t have that sensitivity to understand where he is overstepping.

SO FIRST THAT HURTED SHUBHANKAR.

And like i said because we have such similarity in personality, ambitions, likings that i shubhankar see uskja distance grow hone lga.

Aur wo dono cousins thee ek dusre ko time see jante thee to unke paas jayda aapas mei utni intersting chiz baat krne ke liye nhi thi and i was bundle of so many stories of childhood and grew up in different places and those foreign experience that i was able to entertain both more.

Now but with time as we slowly start to REALLY know each other.

AND I LEARNED HE WAS REALLY REALLY NARCISSISTIC PERSON and that didn’t mesh well with my personality, 

I don’t know egoistic i come off as to other people but actually my Biological tendency is seeking DESIRES, CONTROL & POWER so i don’t know i may show narcissistic like traits but that’s not accurate. 

It’s AIMED AT BEING @ Highest power vantage point. I DON’T REALLY NEED TO BE BETTER, i am okay with being lower but just HIGHER POWER POSITION. 

BUT coming back to story FIGHTS STARTED TO HAPPEN BETWEEN ME AND KARTIKEY .

It was the first time i ever had these type of arguments and it was new experience, i saw myself as the last person who can ever even have fights.

NEVER IN MY LIFE I HAD REAL FIGHT WITH ANYBODY. NEVER.

I didn’t know how to negotiate so we both can be happy.

WE FOUGHT OVER EVERYTHING.

Is Pi=22/7 or 3.14… 

What Log(0)?

What is 1/0 ?

Maths questions

Physics questions.

Gods exist or not?

AND IT TURNED INTO A DYNAMIC WHERE TWO OF US WERE CONSTANTLY effort to one UP each other.

Other is wrong and i am right.

I DIDN’T WANTED THIS.

I was okay with saying “Bhiya thike tum shi ho.”

let’s just enjoy and not be this serious. 

And i tried but my communications skills were lacking and he wasn’t ready to put the sword down.

It was mostly due to narascissim and little jealousy.

I got far better marks (I wasn’t focusing really on school), In maths and physics of school he ahd low marks than me. I knew and acknowledged that he is very talented so marks don’t represent actual potential, BUT I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BOTHERED HIM and he may think that i laugh at him for that cuz he will stop talking much.

I received more praise from teachers and other males and females both saw me as a genius.

Because in maths and physics atleast i used to recieve lot of praise from sir.

I knew class11th maths some and how to apply it in class9th in weird creative ways.

Example- you remember those type of questions.

 Covert 1.432 bar into fraction, ya 1.3333…. into fraction

I came up with that it’s basically an infinite GP, so when you apply that you can solve it like that;.

THOSE WAY OF SOLVING WERE NOWHERE IN ANY BOOK IN 9th and 11th. I came with myself so SIR WAS IMPRESSED.

I can think of ways that even 11th 12th concepts in 9th and i can basically think those pathways

FROM JUST SELF-STUDY. I started coaching material later.

I ALWAYS POSSESED THIS DEEP MAHTEMATICAL INTUTION LIKE 

In 5th class they teach construction.

So there i was able to think of how this thing actually work.

Like in first thing

Draw60 why does it work when you draw semi-circle and cut 3parts on arc.

It’s equilateral triangle that we draw. Let me show you…

And why angle bisector of two points work that you draw equal length arc from both point. Reason-all isoceles triangle with those two points will have same altitude that will be the angle bisector too

SO IN EVERYTHING THAT WAS TAUGHT I CAN KIND OF SEE THE UNSPOKEN THINGS. 

  

There was also there a intelligent, cute, slim/petit body, reserved new girl who will try to make conversations with me 

And it wasn’t like she was type of girl who will flirt and talk with every boy, she was introverted and reserved, i never noticed her talking with any boy.

But she who seemed curious about me so she will try to talk to me & strike conversation.

Like a remember an incident with kartikey

In arts period we have to move to different class section where all mix, so she sat on seat that was just ahead of me and started talking with me little.

Kartikey couldn’t tolerate it and he commented something rude, that made further conversation awkward.

KARTIKEY MAYBE FELT JEALOUSY.

BUT I WASN’T LIKE ARROGANT/BOASTFUL ABOUT THIS..

Even in that 

I was oblivious and just dismissed that as curiosity and i had really low self worth. 

Why will someone even like me? 

I am a defective and impaired person. FROM CHILDHOOD I HELD THAT BELIEF. 

I really wished i was born in different body to differnet parents or i was just orphan. ANYTHING BUT ME

  
  

 tried to recal rhink of memories, say things to myself that'll put me in hopelessness or futility of all mood.

  

People feel safer saying no.

They feel like they retain their autonomy.

I dint want to start on foundation of lies, i want the two of us to feel this as meaningful and connected.

If we lie then we won't be able to enjoy it and it will with time be harder to reveal truths.

  

If you don't feel comfortable sharing or don't want to talk about something of past.

It's okay.

Atleast for future and now

Let's be sincere and honest

we're lovers that have vowed our future to each other

  

Fl2 You know you are my ideal wife

Fl2 eyes shine up, she smiles, hugs mc and rubs her face in his chest as she relaxes

  

FL1 Huh! "My perfect and ideal wife." You never said something like that to me? Am i not good enough for you?

Mc - no it's not like that you are

Fl - i am ?

Crosses her hands

Mc - you wre more than just wife to me. You are my bestfriend and most trusted commadre along with being my beautiful and amazing wif e 

  

I actually never had fight where i will loose. I mean what's the point of fighting if your aren't going to win?

Yes i had friendly banters with my padosi Wale bhiya where we tried to overwhelm it wasn't hurting each other badly

Apne see choto see ldke khush holo

  

Kyu Tera khada nhi hota

  

I have so many first times to wait for and this pain will only make them sweeter but i don't work just for those reward. Those are side product.

Actually pursuing then will make me miserable

  

When i came here and didn't like place all i wanted was to run away from here.

It's difficult to put into words just how desperate I was

Anywhere but here.

I don't care nature or whatever.

Just i want to go away somewhere else.

How am I supposed to explain.

If i throw you in gutter and then i say stars are so beautiful today.

Will you think about stars? Do stars even matter.

I wanted to go away in kota but

Then i got thrown into deeper sewage that exist in my mind so this shallow sewer become insignificant.

  

Puucha nhi jaata ho jata hai

  

If i actually see an person as enemy then i will first start by sending him a letter of friendship

  
  

Tsgy- you know i felt so shame upon myself why i can't do such simple and normal thing.

  
  

All you need to know he hated and there were multiple reasons and it's complicated but

But one of the pillars behind his hatred was him thinking "i have deep rooted jealousy against him, so i poached his best-friend to satiate my jealousy"

And because of that hell always find seat back of our seat or front of us, but he will find seat.

Always wherever I go.

So this is the premide of group dynamics and my position.

  
  
  

For now let's leave it at this, if I'll tell you story it will break flow.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Kartikey and shubhankar bestfriends and cousins.

When i came, kartikey made fun g him a lot and crossed lines and auntiyo ki tarah wo jo kisi tisre inassan ki story discuss krte hain.

Pr hmesha pich bhi nhi uske muh r Bhi, Waise wo mujhe story btata tha, so overtime their friendship eroded.

  
  
  

Never become ungrateful no matter how cold blows you recieve be grateful

  

And if i

  
  
  
  

The two kartike and shubhankar were actually cousins and known each other for long time so they were like bestfriend.

Aur unhe ustime tk Mera jaisa koi pradni nhi mila.

And the dynamic between three people group and two people group is different

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Between kartikey and me, we were both very egotistical and a power hungry type of temperament.

Because we were so same in so many aspect. We fought a lot. Had lot of ego fights to try to one-up each other. 

But if i meet someone who is same as me now, there can't be any fight cause the suffering i was dept with, i can no longer hate anyone who has seen the same places i have to see.

  

Piku doens't care about choice of hole but the feeling of being taken by younhow ever you wants her

  

The voice in my head will tell me, my value, very loudly, so loud that you'll become deaf to the others voice.

The only voice that you hear is.

  

Piku- kya bnau?

Kuch aaisa bnao jo mujhe khush kre. 

(Bring a good gift for piku too)

  
  

Tum kyu gussa ho rhe hon,

Aaisa thodi hi tha me bchne ke liye tumge khayi mei Dhaka dediya.

Tum dono khai mei gire aur meri jhe bhi khichne ke koshis krte hai.

  
  
  

Kartikey the first close friend, i made in new school and actually for the first time, i got a friend whose brain is at same resonance of mine.

But problem with him was he was too competitive and bit narcissistic.

So whether we will talk about something.

For example - i remeber, i told him

"I have always felt this story sense of destiny, that amount of coincidences that happened in my life. it'll take for me to be as i am today. They all almost feel impossible. If i were to become god and guide myself. I can't repeat it.

It feels as if some stranger force of destiny guiding me."

He said to me.

He felt the same, told how he reached his present life.

But at last he added point.

He thought all this 8-9 months ago.

  

So whatever i will talk with him about this existential feelings, he will tell he have thought all thisfew months earlier than me.

  

Which slowly evolved into him saying he can read my mind.

Even though let's say i just enter class, sit down, and we haven't even talked much, he can read my mind.

Them he will laugh in

sly/mischievous way.

  

Okay lets say for me, you can read my mind. But why Shubhankar too.

  

He thought that i poached his best-friend as form of revenge.

  

He will say the team of them used to be so good friends, but now i have ruined that. Using divide and rule.

Shubhankar will agree to his words and i found that so hypocritical

You two are still alive, breathing living, in front of each other.

  

I didn't have that much verbal intelligence developer, thag i can clear the wrong view they hold.

And i just didn't knew how to dispel this miscommunication because noone taught me.

  

Aaise kbde phen kr sharam nhi aati hain.

  

Slowly slowly the sensation of fear and quivering feels bearable. The feeling and my body shaking and all those things don't go away but feeling of that terror is something i become little okay with, then i go to other people too.

  

She lowered her voice and started to talk, she does that whenever she is serious but shy about something. She told me she wanted to feel special and not like a fuck machine. She wanted a night with Bijoy as his loving wife and celebrate a first-night kind of thing with him.

  

He too was smelling her time to time and it made her aroused profoundly.

  

Gentle eyes look

  

Saree-celebrate, special days,

ShortSkirt - normal days, simple happiness enchance

  

Food is still not prepared.

You are gandi wife apne pati ko bhukha rkhti hon, mera aacha dil Han to tumhe maar ke sudharta nhi hun.

Mujhe abhi kuch khane ko chahiye.

Tum jo khilaogi, tumhe Mera dhyaan rkhna chahiye Naa?

Piku-xyss....

Kuch mitha,

Sbse bhi mithi chiz Jo Ghar mein hain

  

Someone who is warm, gentle, fuzzy must have been loved a lot growing up.

And maybe someone who is distant wanted to be loved

  
  
  

When someone compliments for be extra in skill.

Say thankyou. Don't explain trick.

Example - your vocabulary is good.

Don't explain how you did it. Just say thankyou.

  

If some relative every disrespect piku forward or backward, I'll talk to them face to face.

Never will I be so weak that i willn't standup and fight for her.

Piku is my pride, my status symbol.

I can be disrespected and laughed at but not piku.

Its my duty to fight for my pikus owner even if i get berated.

  
  

Can i pull your cheeks?

Just what creature are you?

Hmm...uh pulls piku cheee make her head move here there.

Mere gaal tight hogye hai ask piku to strech.

Piku streches.

If you want to pull someones cheek then we can bring a children into world.

Not one but lot of cute babies.

HAN PAAR TUMHaRE GAAL KHIcHNE Ki FEEliNG ALAG HAI.

  

...................................

Values

--------------------------

Piku WILL be my pride.

But i willnt disgrace her to get cheap respect and show i am so big.

Ill obviously boast about my wife but never anything that'll bring disgrace to her.

I won't be disgracing her but myself.

-----------------------------

I wasn't weak. I was never weak.

I was actually strong person with strong value system bt what they programmed into values was bunch of crap.

They filled me up with value that made me internally weak and coward.

There were no strong role models, no strong story.

Remember ayush incident.

Was it so much fun? Was the pain you would might undergone so bad that you'll push your friend off.

  

Why are all story they teach so simple minded?

Just empty, shallow words and naive concepts.

  

With anshu,

I thought i was weak i didn't standup properly and speak.

But reality was it wasn't entirely my fault.

The values and morals i was taught were weak, childish, naive.

Is it so fun that you are okay with putting in so much pain?

Will you still laugh? When she walks and sees that road.

So stupid and wuwu stories.

I can talk countless stories.

One of the stories that comes to mind was

Do you recall:

The enemy.

The part where

  

How can he bring someone who is enemy soldier to his home

and risk his whole family.

It's so morally wrong. I don't care country just the someone who is dangerous in my home.

I will burn someone alive even knowing that he have wife and children. Ill burn him alive than to bring home.

He could have just given emergency treatment and handed over. He wasn't being human

  
  
  

Devrath used to do martial art and even there went for taekowodo competition, he went to Indonesia sayad.

But problem was he was too fixated on kicks, which i don't felt did him any good.

Cuz i used to be fat and heavy weight so as long as i am protecting my face.

His kicks can make me little slower but it can't inflict any lethal or restrictive damage, if i am deliberately taking in his kicks.

And once i am closed enough that kicks don't work here anymore,

And if he still tries with his kick then there is nothing more stupid cuz as i told, i am heavier and bigger than him, its easy for me to pin him down.

  

Tumhare haath see khane see swad to aata hai pr khane ka nhi aata

  

And from there just grab neck and back and hit continuousluly on back

  

Innocent backrub leads to

You know what i am in mood for

  
  

In situation when you use brahmastra

Piku you asked me to wait till...

But what if you get swayed by emotions and i manage to convince you

  
  

FL2 is making food and it's late than the time it was supposed to be so mc hungry and groans little, fl1 comes up and says she can maybe satiate him little while they wait.

In front of FL1

  
  
  

You don't know how happy it makes you seeing & hearing you humming.

I can replay this memory countless time to make myself happy

Piku mem tumse milta nhi to Mera kya hota

Tumhe aur smile krte gungunate dekhne ke liye kya kru main?

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

In beginning tell my school was very strict and rigid about rules and lot of kids were complacent to rule.

Over small things they can even call at home to parents.

Or kids getting suspended for misconduct.

I have heard lot of stories

  
  
  

Sir asked itni hasi kyu AA rhi (english main)

I was still laughing, even my friend is on ground and still the scene of hm getting beaten was replaying.

He was acting like usme mata**** chdh gyi hai(*********)

Ab me apna

Not so bright future dekh skta tha.

Sir phele mujhe marenge.

Phir pata chalega kya actual case tha aur phir mujhe dugna marenge.

Phir principal upar aaynge ya mujhe niche bulaya jayga.

Restigate krne, aur extremely extremely good scenario mere Ghar pr call hoga is maar ke baad, is puri class ke samne maar kr bezzati krne ke baad,

Aur meri class kee bhot paas mei 6th class thi meri cousin kii aur wo bhi chugli krega.

Pr meri hasi abhi bhi nhi ruki thi, me apne muh pr haath rkh kr taki pain hi atleast meri hasi roke pr kuch help nhi hui.

  

sir ne pucha whats so funny?

  

Mene sir niche hi rkha aur kuch bola nhi. Aur khudki body ko hard kiya impact kee liye,

Pr mujhe thpd nhi lga.

Mene apne nazaree uthaiye sir mere respone ka wait kr rh thee,

Aur baki class ke bchoo nee circle bana liya jàaise zoo ke janwar ko sb dekh rhe hain.

  

Mene phir see sir nicche Kiya kii sir marlo na kyu aaisa drama, kyu kr rhe ho maaro aur khatam kro

  

sir ne pucha whats so funny?

  

Meri hasi ab ruk gyi

  

Mene bola sir see - pichee see bche hasa rhe thee.

Lamest excuse. Zero creativity.

Mene halka explain Kiya ki hm dono khde thee shubhankar and me piche see bche hasane lgee

  

Jb mene upaar mud kr dekha to mene realise Kiya sir actually me mujhe genuinely sun rhe hai.

  

Aur mujhe realise hua sir mujhe respect type see dekhte isliye mere words me actually more weight hain than i imagine.

Isliye sir nee mujhe bhi maarna start nhi kr diya aur genuinely sun rhe hain.

  

Sir nee pucha kon bche thee.

  

Ab mujhe pta hai mere words me weight hai to mujhe soch kr bolna hai

  

Mene bola kartikey aur devansh aur undono namuno ki tarf dekha jo hmare pichee baithte thee,

  

Wo dono abhi tk daat dikha kr hs rhee thee

Aur wo scene just comical tha ki kaise wo Suddenly just bokhla gaye

  

Aur wo dono sir sir yee woo

Unka dimag haywire hogya wo mujhe dikh rha tha aur dono hi bol rhe thee aur explain kr re thee sir ko

HOW THIS TRADEGY took place and HOW ITs MY MIsTAKe

  
  

Mee bs yee expression apne face pr maintain kr rha tha

Ki tum dono yee kya baate kr rhe ho? Me to class me bhi nhi tha jb yee sb hua jo yee tum kahani hol Rhee ho?

Muh nhi khola, jaroorat nhi thii Mee bs dekh rha tha.

  

Sir nee hm dono kee bich me dekha

Unhe bich Mee hi rok diya jb wo baat kr rhe thee aur mujhe pucha tum btao kya hua.

  

I wasn't prepared with a lie story.

So i tried to play off

Ki sir hamara ldko wali backchodi kr Rhee thee aur yee Puri class kee samne bolna appropriate.

I can't speak in front of class.

  

Sir nee pucha ki Mee bolu kya baat thi.

  

Sir yee ashlel baate kr rhe thee.

  

Me bolne wala thaa pr bola nhi kyuki abhi tk mujhe ek bhot bigger problem side of brain mei CHL rhi thii

  

Shubhankar! Jo jamin pr abhi bhi dharashaai thaa.

Me indono ko pitwadu aur khud abhi bch jau.

Wo sir ko uth kr boldega,

Aur end me mera lie expose hoga.

Pr aaisa nhi hai ki mei hopeless hu.

Me phele see sir ko koi aaisi story bol skta hu ki jisme yee tino mujhe bully type kr rhe thee.

Aur agar Mee yee story sir ko phele feed krunga, jisse phele shubhankar inke saath forces join krta Hain mein bch jaunga

  

Pr phir Mee apni value break kr rha hunga.

Kartikey ko 9th class wala agrim ek Ganda isaan Soni am just delivering justice to him.

Pr shubhankar and in that moment memories were flowing in mind of incident where kartikey and shubhankar were laughing and making fun of one-two kids and it was verbal bullying.

So maybe he deserve it.

But in my mind i know i am trying to fool myself so in the

Even for kartikey i felt i was doing a bad thing little but i said to myself justice.

  

This big dialogue (moral conflict) i just said i was thinking all of this in back of kind ever since,

Kartikey dewansh bokhlague thee aur sir ko explain kr Rhee thee.

Mei tb see hi yee soch rha tha.

  

I didn't knew what to do. But i can't betray my friend, so i just did what come naturally to me.

  

Pr phele mene abhi present topic change Kiya.

Sir joke puch rhe hain.

Lets change topic and get some control

I started to rant in front of sir, how kartikey in sst class was piche see Marni ki kosis kr rha tha, chuti kaata hai, aur baki ussne kaisi pressan kiyaa Aaj throughout school, hm dono seat bdlne ki koshis krte hai pr wo piche aajata hain.

Halka falsify and exaggerate krke.

  

When i eneded sir was looking between me and kartikey.

I didn't knew if my lie was convincing enough

  

Sir was looking between us.

Sigh.

I know i was loosing so just doing the last fight i can do.

  
  

I turned towards shubhankar i was ready that i will go to him.

And shake him ask him in anger and aggressive tone.

Kartikey wo 4th period mei hme preshan kr rha tha,

Hana.

(Hopefully wo Han kh dega aur sir usse proof manlebge.)

  

I don't know.

Mera luck kharab hain.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Sst

-Story is long

-First let me give you little background so you can enjoy the story

And introduction to setting and character

1) sir from kerela, Goa, tamilnadu, Karnataka something like that, talk in english

2)  real struggle keep wake up, accent

One time i was sitting on middle row, front seat and there too, i slept for 4-7min.

I don't know if sir noticed

3) case wasn't same with whole class.

Class would be laughing, lively, joking with sir.

I would be struggling to wake up.

4)Aur yee kafi nhi thaa, to jo mere side me mera mitr SHUBHANKAR baitha tha.

Wo bhot funny aur charming personality thi, aur ven in 100 people group he will stand out.

5) saare teacher use maarte thee pr pasand bhi krte thee.

To class mein sir kee saith banter aur joke krne ki frontline pe tha, to agar mei Sona bhi chahu chupkee see so nhi skta thaa,

6) bohot baar me usse sst period me chod kr kisi aur kono mei chupne jaata tha.

+++----++++

7)Okay now the other animal.

Who behind me kartikey.

Kartikey believed - poached bestfriend jealous

Yes he is a pig, i can hunt and poach

Wont leave me and sit behind or front of me to annoy me and take out his bitterness. Annoying.

-if i try to explain full context it will break tone so lets leave it at that.

  

.

------------

Now let's start the story

0) i moved from sleepy to hungry

1) i would have eaten my lunch but i was sitting on side(use fingers to show)

2) if take out some chugalkhor kid will start doing sir sir

3) i endure bells ring

Reliveed

4)takes lunch out

5) Yet everyone else stands up

6) class serious

Look around - noone talking or trying to talk to other, or supressig happiness

7) PURE SILENCE AND SERIOUSNESS.

I put my lunch back

  B) subhe announcement Hui to thi- me khoya khoya insaan hun, to announcment hui bhi hogi to mene dhyaan nhi diya hoga.

   C) gandhiji maar gye!

I said to myself

Gandhiji mar gyee sigh

9) Gandhiji

My mind started producing memes of Gandhi

  
  
  

Bachpan mei mujhe chipkali see bhot drr lgta tha kyuki ek do baar wo mujh pr gir gyi thee.

To isliye uske naam hi email krdiya

  
  

Mene baat mani thi mummy ki, me kuch din nhi baitha, pr apni biradri ka koi aur Mila nhi

  
  

5th class beggining

Wo last person thi jisse me chahunga Kunal complain kre.

Mere dimag ke switch flip hue aur mene usse bola

Kya hogya, mujhe dikhao.

Aao Kunal reception chlte hai,

Pr wo utha nhi.

Mene bola thik ha kaam see bleeding to rok lo rumal see.

Usne koi reaction nhi diya.

Yee loo Mera rumal

Bs uss khon ko pocho

  

Mene utne pyaar see kbhi nhi bola hoga, but sb kuch itne naturally as rha tha.

Pr wo seat see nhi uthaa

  

It was new school, i barely new names and faces, and i don't remeber who i smack in face.

  

Yee sb problem nhi hoti ahgar wo pyaar see man jata aur reception chlta.

Pr uske dil Mee achai aur kindness ki koi kimat hi kha tha

  

Music, dance, games ka syaad period thaa.

Mera bestfriend tha jo responsible thas class Mai kon rukega uske liye.

Me hi hamesa ruk jata thaa.

Rudra bhi niche nhi jana chahta tha to wo bhi class Mai baith gaya.

Mene rudra ko bola

Agar koi teacher dikha

Good morning bolna

Aur jakar aache see jhukr paar chuho, haath see yee kro.

Phir see goodmorning sir bolna aur sir jhukana.

Teacher nhi rokega.

Kyuki wo baat hai na ki agar

Tum let's say show me lot of respect then i willnt do an action that may break that

Aur waise bhi tecaher ko bcche respect nhi krte, to unke liye bhi thida refreshing hoga

  

Class5 age- begin-10 end-11

10yrs Kunal incident

I was shy and coward kid, meri kbhi himmat nhi hogi wo bhi naye school Mai ki mei reception to jau, pr apne dost ko trouble mei dekh kr mujhe duniya ki sari courage aagayi.

  

Obviously usse pta tha me kya game khel rha hun

Aur mei bhi subtle nhi tha.

  

Mujhe abhi tk chahre aur naam shi see yad nhi tha, (no need to say again I'm new in school) aur me jyada drunk tha chehre aur naam yaad rkhne kee liye.

10) aur ek pig ko mar khate hu dekh, Haas Haas kr uski aakhe itni bdi hogi thi

.

  

Mera number aaya, meri hasi abhi tk nhi ruki

Sir ask what's funny

I know, my future is not so bright. STILL i have to protect my dignity,

But my laughing won't stop.

  

Thing is that when lot of people are involved then one single person won't get that strict punishment and call at all home

Maybe i can DILUTE MY SINS.

First aim was to just create story messy

  

-keep story vague like till now, ki you know, sir punish everyone

- and now needle is shifting to place where all blame is on kartikey

Jo actually mujhe help nhi krega

Kyuki kartikey ki pitne ke bad my friend jo dharasahi hokar pda hai usne forces join krke bta Diya too I WILL LOOSE.

Maybe i can frame my words such that sir uske words ko bhi koi value nsa deee but phir uska matlab Mee usse betray krunga Jo me kr nhi skta aur meri wajah see wo pita hai to mujhe thoda bura bhi lg rha thaa.

To Mera mind thoda blank ho rha thaa,

I am still smiling playfully

If all [was.in](http://was.in/) Hindi, maybe i can spin conversation a little, in English where i am translating Hindi to English. Me khud ki beezati krwa rha hunga.

I said sir piche see poke kr rhe thee, after that i tried to shift conversation by saying that they were annoying distrubing us in sst period and we ( me and shubhankar) ask them to go sit somehowere else but they keep annoying is.

  

Me abhi normal tone mei ek baar mei bol diya, pr aasi situation Mai jaha mujhe words nhi aa rhe hai aur Mee aatak kee bol rha hun.

Mujhe nhi pta mere words ka kya effect hua. Aur. Mujhe embarasmrnt feel ho rhi thi thodi.

  

Pr pr tbhi sir nee hmari dono ki seat pee dekha uspr pen ki cap ulti rkhi Hui thi, sir nee cap uthai aur pucha yee kiski.hai.

  
  

Lively playful person, money isn't the metric that job and success is female thing

  

ng and

Second option-

  

Sir preesed me for answer.

It's difficult to answer an direct question vaguely morever when i am translating Hindi to English then speak so

  
  
  

Remember eternal boredom since childhood you thought it'd disappear in future that time never came, human world is boring very less to offer, not your fantasy world.

You have to create a beautiful world of your own no reasom to bow for world that won't offer you anything

Perhaps i am the one to blame, not the people who surrounded me. They weren't at fault. It was me. Doens't mean i am broken. No compass is ever broken, it always point somewhere maybe not the direction where other humans intends it to be, but it always does oint somewhere.

I have to craft the right direction for me the path that will lead me to place where i will like o be.

  

I was thinking of 

Word - Nature

1.  Nature = Innate Quality.
    

We think nature as earth nature

Nature and the concept of "Mother Earth" are often used interchangeably in our society, but this view may be flawed. We are taught that the world's innate quality is nature and that humans are being too arrogant to think they are beyond it. However, if we consider the true nature of the world and its history, the reality is quite different. The world's environment was once inhospitable to life, with oceans containing too much iron to support it. It was only through the evolution of cyanobacteria  forms that the oxygen content increased and oxidised the iron, making it habitable. When we look at other planets and beyond our solar system, we see that nature as we know it on Earth is not a universal phenomenon. The true nature of the world is hostile to life and is in fact anti-nature

2.  Nature = 
    

HOW IT IS PORTRAYED THAT NATURE IS STRONG & DOMINEERING FORCE. Humans are weak they should know their place. 

Only humans have chance to spread it to other planets’, protect from meteors, and other dangers which nature is too weak to space

  

3.  Nature & Pollution
    

We call our sewers polluted but aren’t they place where lot of bacteria and animals thrive.

nALL=-ve connotation

YET BECAUSE IT’S LETHAL FOR Majority we CALL Their habitat “Polluted”

And we SAY IT NEGATIVELY AFFECT nature which is evaluated on basis of majority's evolution.

What if in an alternate universe if drinking sewage water extended lifespan and cured many diseases will humans still call it polluted won't they would call it as drink that taste bad but it will be good (A MEDICINE)

Religion- WINE OF GOD

 Krishna ji naali ka paani chori krenge

  

Earth and other beings don't give fuck about order. The balance only exist because they can use each otehr withoutgetting in way HTOSE WHO RESUSED TO ALIGN WILL be killed eventually.

Other beings evolution just haven’t caught up yet. If we give may1000yrs they can evolve and new diversity of species can come which thrive in new climate

  
****  

ACTUALLY IN THE BEGINNING EARTH WAS CO2 blob humans didn’t do new thing, O2 was superlow.

It was cyanobacteria that evolved.

Increased O2 in atmosphere.

And in those time SEA WAS MAYBE RED-BROWN COLOUR FILLED WITH IRON SO IT WASN’T HABITATBLE FOR PRESETNT DAY LIFEFORM ATLEAST.

But they increase O2 so so much that O2 oxidsied iron in sea and turned ocean blue.

BUT IT KILLED A LOT OTHER BEINGS WHICH FEED OF CO2 and that type of enviornment

  

"Saheb's childhood home in Dhaka, surrounded by lush green fields, now feels like a distant memory. The passing years have dulled its vividness, leaving behind only a jaded impression of his once-beloved homeland."

  

When you can find a silver coin in a heap of garbage, you don’t stop scrounging, for there is hope of finding more

  

“I will learn to drive a car,” he answers, looking straight into my eyes. His dream looms like a mirage amidst the dust of streets that fill his town Firozabad, famous for its bangles

  

Acknowledge the suffering part as good part in habit

  
  
  

There is probability that you’r luck will go awr yand adv. 2nd attempt messed up so you SHOULD HAVE SELF-RESPECT THAT’LL GIVE YOU STRENGTH TO BEAR THAT GUILT AND ALL OTEHR BURDEN DUE TO YOUR LOW OPPORINUTIY POSITION

  
  

It's possible that your difficulty understanding speech in certain situations may be related to your attention and focus rather than your actual hearing ability. If you find that you have a tendency to withdraw or tune out in certain situations, it may be more difficult for you to process spoken language.

One technique that may be helpful is to practice active listening. This means consciously focusing your attention on the speaker and making an effort to understand what they're saying. You can do this by making eye contact with the speaker, nodding or using other nonverbal cues to show that you're listening, and asking questions or repeating back what you've heard to ensure that you've understood correctly.

LISTEN TO PEOPLE SPEAKING BIHARI OR DIALECTICAL HINDI AND LEARN TO PLAY GOD CLOSE ATTNENTIOJN TO FULL VOICE till you make it unconscious.

YOu have to do this like you’ll do with facial expressions and other stuff

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

HOW MANY PEOPLE IN PAST, CRUSHING ISOLATION FEEL DUE TO DISEASE CASTED OUT OF SOCIETY.

BODY PUNISH BRAIN SO BADLY FOR BEING CAST AWAY

  

Key to playfulness confidence- 

1.  is to be here, yet not be here, have something else occupy & possess your mind, thought of something else, don’t mind the meager stuff you see and encounter stay with something else, something better, maybe a novel, a thought, a poem. Something more serene and beautiful.
    
2.  This all is just transaction game (Barter System). Just a game, a lie, Everyone plays on themselves and others.
    

Interaction with everyone - Mom, Dad, each individual friend, each individual teacher/proffessor, each individual stranger.

WHY NOT MAKE YOUR ONLY CONTRACTED ONE YOURSELF. Don’t give anyonbe contract to your soul, ONLY SURFACE.

When talking or discussing something. ALWAYS

  

Remeber at lower potential you felt like you have even forgotten  how to be happy, something has gone terribly wrong and you would never be bale to be happy ever again.

  

Every reaktionship/bond is TRANSACTION. but now you can either see all transaction as unholy or all transaction as holy.

  
  

MOTIVATION/DESIRE/VALUES

-To stand up for myself, piku, in front of a group.

TO stand alone in front of a group and say KYA PROBLEM HAI. 

You need strength, big body, and INTIMIDATION.

Not for ego flaunting, whenever get the chance, with some niobody,

But when i see it’s necessary for me to  stand up

-It wasn't me who was weak, but the values i was taught was so weak, and so much wuwu

-Ant me chude tum, wo nhi

  
  
  
  

You follow rules/DynamicsFriendshipsNorms for the service you get in return from insititution/Bonds. If instiutions/DynamicsFriendships aren't serving you, then why follow the rules? 

YOU IMPOSE & FORCE YOUR WILL. 

You tear a hole in fabric, you make a step outside of chessboard.

DON’T BE COMPLACENT.

  
  
  

LEARN AND PRACTISE PROPER SMILE SEEING LECTURES/VIDEOS/PODCAST FORM AND PRACTISE PROPER EXPRESSIONS

  
  
  

Ab mera daar shif thogya, pencil ssee cheating pr, YEE COPY BOARDS MAI OFFICIAL POLACES MAI BHI JAATI HAI. FUCK FUCK.

MERE MUMMY PAP KEE PAAS MERI HARDLY COMPLAIN JAATI THI AUR AAJ JO KAHTARNAK WALI PHELI BAAR JAYGI WO HOGI KI “MEI LDKIYO KO CHEATING KARRATA HUN. PLEASE GOD KILL ME”

  
  
  

BREAK INERTIA

You can analyze pattern and copy way of speaking those idiots and all in 1 hour, that small talk wasn't a soulful conversation, what you desire to learn and will be use to you, were the conversation of TORQ & AMALGAM, YOU wish to utilize that and learn it

  
  

English vs maths which is more hard. DIFFICULTY IS STUPID but maths and programming are kind of unifacted where english has so much more dimensions to it AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE AT LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING & EXPERIENCE TO EVEN SEE SOMETHING IS THERE MUCH LESS APPRECIATE WHAT IT IS. It's not like maths where everything is clearly laid out step by step. 

No but in maths programming path, maethods to use are defined and laid out in english you carve your own way following an initution

That's true, in programming and math, there are often well-defined rules and procedures to follow to arrive at a correct solution. However, in English, there is often a degree of subjectivity and interpretation involved. While there are certainly rules of grammar and structure to follow, there is also a lot of nuance and creativity involved in effectively communicating a message. Additionally, understanding and appreciating literature, poetry, and other forms of written expression requires a level of cultural and historical knowledge that may not be required in math or programming. So, while both subjects have their own unique challenges, they do require different skill sets and ways of thinking.

I understand what you are saying. In math and programming, the methods and steps to solve a problem are clearly defined and laid out. However, in English, one must often rely on intuition and a deep understanding of language and culture to interpret and convey meaning. It can be difficult to know if you are making progress or wasting time in your study of English, as progress may not be as easily measurable as it is in math and programming. The nuances and subtleties of English can take time and practice to fully understand and appreciate.

Yes it's like realisations of what you thought of world as child and what you learn later. Without actually seeing anything you don't see anything in english. IN MATHS A DOGAM HAS BEEN LAID OUT WHICH FI YOU FOLLOW WITH DILLGENCE WILL ALWAYS BE AT YOUR BACK whearas IN ENGLISH YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE PROGRESSING OR MAYBE WASTING TIME/ DEGRADING.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Pollution and animal population dwindling.

I understand but I think humans limit copopulation is good, but i won’t stop and lower my rate.

And it feels childish to think feeding 8billion people won’t kill animals.  
It’s foolish.

WHY DO WE SEE HUMANS AS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT NATURE and ANIMALS ARE WEAK, FRAGILE WORK OF NATURE?

What do you thin kwill happen if there were 8billion tigers or lions or leopards?

Will they not kill lot of animals too?

So obviously humans does it too and it’s inevitable.

Yes we CAN AND SHOULD TRY TO MINIMISE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT.

But I don't think the jungle or animal kingdom works on KINDNESS, EMPATHY AND LOVE.

I remeber that kid in jpm, was talking that he calls his gf, he wants to fuck so he 

Ask can i come hope at 4.

She say 5.

The he convinces.

My memory and language comprehension was oo loud to remeber whole.

But i just felt like

"Wo tumhe chod rhi hai, tum usse nhi"

First i will never call out like pathetic animal that i want … please come.

If i ever ask her, it will more of saying that i want too see you in saree.

  
  

Say this to piku 

If I do something that you don't like, stop me. 

Instead of asking, can i do this?

Stop me if you don't want this.

Piku will you try to stop me, if i push you for….

  
  

Kisiko timepass Krna hoga tb wo whi pee he mandrana chahega

  

Rudra, i coined his nickname diaper, Pampers, manypokopants.

Diaper(say diaper not rudra)  was kid of a teacher mam who had high position,

She held position in results decision of competitions in school and organisation little too. Plus senior science teacher.

(No bad raport, don't say, they will project qualities you say onto you.

His personality was like his petname, like an 2 year old who thinks he owns, the world, high narcissism and kind of entitlement.

Try to make stroy fun, skim out unfluent protion)

  

 when he said bdsk kon hai? Or something like that.

Now his personality and voice didn't have that roughness so i used to cringe whenever he tries to be like he was in this type of attitude, i didn't even knew the word cringe then.

But he started to laugh. And i laughed both at different things.

Heavy voice.

I got down on floor.

And started tightening screws robots and dismantling little.

I wasn't scared actually wanted to see what will happen to rudra. 

He says in such a motherly way

Agrim aap aaise nhi, yee kro

Sir asked us to show how robit runs.

  
  
  

(#breaks flow

Knowing his character he will put the blame on me if he had opportunity to, so i was really alert.

I say down and i actually wasn't that scared cuz i deep inside knew that 

For sir i am just random kid xyz and he is rudra. 

He is the protagonist of scene, i am a bystander.)

  

Don't tell this to others cause this will harm innocence 

Piku well how should I

 explain this.

You see i think there are two emotions that is felt by female.

Like there is gloomy feeling, cherry feeling, anxious feeling,

Similar to all those it's a feeling and it's a strong passie force over the will.

Like in cherry mood and anxious mood you will perceive a situation, think about future, your past memories and every thing you depend on whether your emotional state is Anxious.

Don't confuse it with love, i think love is something hing male and female feels same type but 

These passiveforce are mor exclusive more to male.

Passive seeing where wife/lover/gf

1.  Meaing related 
    
2.  Lust/ visual related
    

Meaning related one is what will enchance the feeling of wanting to take care, protect you,  and do anything 

BUt it's not do anything in serving & wanting to please way,

but more in terms of protecting, even if you have to die.

And by dying i mean it literally, 

not in romantic poetic wuwu just an innate drive that will make you ready to die if needed.

Makes you feel territorial and possessive.

Normally when you hear possessiveness, a toxic and negative view point, that's a sign of insecurity.

But thats oversimplification i feel it's core resides in protection.

If let's say i have watch that's special to me , maybe a special gift keepsake i hold dare, i will care 

who dares to touch my watch. Is it safe? It will not get damaged.

I will always try my best to be attentive and it's stems from protective core, but from behaviour can be judge as insecure.

But but but you can be secure about watch but then it's more like

Who cares if it gets stolen or broken,

You can always buy a new one, there are infinite watch in market.

  

So someone can be 

Secure (but what is the core of the security, you must not forget. But you can chill)

–

Insecure/Protective (because soemthing precious that you can't just give up, even if you have to suffer pathetically)

Reason why it's precious  vary person to person.

  
  

My favourite type of trope or novels i should say a

Are fansty fiction novel in medivialish setting.

Romance novels. But romance but it shouldn't be too dramatic. 

male character lead is cunning/clever man.

Female lead is someonr of high social standing, and older than mc.

Mere class me  wale do pradniyo ke baare mei batana hai jinka yha pr mei bsne wale do pradniyo ke baare mei batana hai jinka yha pr jo janwar involved hai.

  

Phele Janwar jo mera mitr mere bgl mei baaitha tha uska naam, shubhankar tha, wo bhot funny tha, saare teacher usse daate the pr psnd bhi krte thee.

  

Aur dusra pradni jo hmqari seat ke piche baitha tha uska naam kartikey tha, aur usske baare mei abhi bss yee jn lo ki wo MUJHE BHOT HATE krta tha.

ISKE PICHE LMBI DAASTAN HAI, agaar wo jaana hai thodi deer baad me bta dunga. Abhi story continue krta hu, bss yhi jaana important hai

Actually bhot reason thee sayad uske hate kee badle pr one of the pillars, yee thaa ki mene dushmani uttarne kee liye uske best-friend ko poch kiya hai.

  
  

ACTUALLY STORY THODI PERSONAL HEI MEI SO IT DOESN’T FEEL RIGHT TO TALK LOUDLY IN GROUP.

Dekho jb mein school mei naya aay tha 9th class mein, to mujhe bhot time tk koi apni biradri kaa nhi mila, jinka saath baaaitha tha wo bhot normal see thee.

Pr class mei do bche thee shubhankar aur kartikey jo best-friend thee, wo class mei sbko hasate thee aur funny personality thii.

To mei jo beghar tha, mei apni bsti whi pr bsana chahta tha.

Meri dosti hui un dono se.

Me ussamy 11th and 12th ki Physics Maths kr rha tha, aur wo dono bhi class12th kee baad engineering IIT karna chahte thee, Pr unme wo passion, energy nhi tha.

PR mei to hmesa see godly ambitious rha hun, 9th mei, mei khali 3-4 hours sota tha aur padhai mein hi. 

1.  shubhanakr mst mooula aur bhot charming personality thii tha to usme utni seriousness, competitiveness, uski soul mei nhi thii mene sbse phele usse. Mujhe pta tha ki mei usse convert nhi kr paunga
    
2.    Kartikey i was able to pass some ambition 
    

He was actually biologically hypercompetitive, ambitious, attentive and intelligent but he never got the environment to push him into his natural order but i was able to give little push into what his natural arrangement should be. 

He too was somewhat like me working day and night

We two became really good friend and will talk a lot about everything physics, maths, PHILOSOPHY, SPIRITUALITY (Hmme see kisiko aaise philosophy and spirituality words nhi pta thee, so were just talking about OUR EXPERIENCE AND FEELING TOWARDS - Sense of destiny, the order of the world, the concept of god, Just our feeling and experience NOONE READ BOOK OR ANYTHING KNOW what this is called.

  

Well shubhankar his old best-friend, wasn’t that ambitionful so he wanted him too to join us, class 11th 12th pdhna aur yee sb discuss.

He wanted to include him.

AND HIS WAY OF MOTIVATING HIM AND PUSHING HIM TO DO ALL THIS WAS BERATING HIM,

I dont remember words but essence was 

Ki tum chuttiye ho, tumhara kuch nhi hoga.

Tumhe yee bhi nhi aata.

In hope his ego will get hurt and he will work, but he was pure creature. UNLIKE ME and kartikey who were PowerHungry jo ek dusre ko maar kaat skte hei, apni power show krne kee liye. HE HAD GENTLE HEART. 

So he didn’t took all that in a positive way, and KARTIKEY had tendency to self-induldge in making fun of fim bearing him and 

THAT”s Maybe expected from someone who had that rough personality so he didn’t have that sensitivity to understand where he is overstepping.

SO FIRST THAT HURTED SHUBHANKAR.

And like i said because we have such similarity in personality, ambitions, likings that i shubhankar see uskja distance grow hone lga.

Aur wo dono cousins thee ek dusre ko time see jante thee to unke paas jayda aapas mei utni intersting chiz baat krne ke liye nhi thi and i was bundle of so many stories of childhood and grew up in different places and those foreign experience that i was able to entertain both more.

Now but with time as we slowly start to REALLY know each other.

AND I LEARNED HE WAS REALLY REALLY NARCISSISTIC PERSON and that didn’t mesh well with my personality, 

I don’t know egoistic i come off as to other people but actually my Biological tendency is seeking DESIRES, CONTROL & POWER so i don’t know i may show narcissistic like traits but that’s not accurate. 

It’s AIMED AT BEING @ Highest power vantage point. I DON’T REALLY NEED TO BE BETTER, i am okay with being lower but just HIGHER POWER POSITION. 

BUT coming back to story FIGHTS STARTED TO HAPPEN BETWEEN ME AND KARTIKEY .

It was the first time i ever had these type of arguments and it was new experience, i saw myself as the last person who can ever even have fights.

NEVER IN MY LIFE I HAD REAL FIGHT WITH ANYBODY. NEVER.

I didn’t know how to negotiate so we both can be happy.

WE FOUGHT OVER EVERYTHING.

Is Pi=22/7 or 3.14… 

What Log(0)?

What is 1/0 ?

Maths questions

Physics questions.

Gods exist or not?

AND IT TURNED INTO A DYNAMIC WHERE TWO OF US WERE CONSTANTLY effort to one UP each other.

Other is wrong and i am right.

I DIDN’T WANTED THIS.

I was okay with saying “Bhiya thike tum shi ho.”

let’s just enjoy and not be this serious. 

And i tried but my communications skills were lacking and he wasn’t ready to put the sword down.

It was mostly due to narascissim and little jealousy.

I got far better marks (I wasn’t focusing really on school), In maths and physics of school he ahd low marks than me. I knew and acknowledged that he is very talented so marks don’t represent actual potential, BUT I AM SURE IT MUST HAVE BOTHERED HIM and he may think that i laugh at him for that cuz he will stop talking much.

I received more praise from teachers and other males and females both saw me as a genius.

Because in maths and physics atleast i used to recieve lot of praise from sir.

I knew class11th maths some and how to apply it in class9th in weird creative ways.

Example- you remember those type of questions.

 Covert 1.432 bar into fraction, ya 1.3333…. into fraction

I came up with that it’s basically an infinite GP, so when you apply that you can solve it like that;.

THOSE WAY OF SOLVING WERE NOWHERE IN ANY BOOK IN 9th and 11th. I came with myself so SIR WAS IMPRESSED.

I can think of ways that even 11th 12th concepts in 9th and i can basically think those pathways

FROM JUST SELF-STUDY. I started coaching material later.

I ALWAYS POSSESED THIS DEEP MAHTEMATICAL INTUTION LIKE 

In 5th class they teach construction.

So there i was able to think of how this thing actually work.

Like in first thing

Draw60 why does it work when you draw semi-circle and cut 3parts on arc.

It’s equilateral triangle that we draw. Let me show you…

And why angle bisector of two points work that you draw equal length arc from both point. Reason-all isoceles triangle with those two points will have same altitude that will be the angle bisector too

SO IN EVERYTHING THAT WAS TAUGHT I CAN KIND OF SEE THE UNSPOKEN THINGS. 

  

There was also there a intelligent, cute, slim/petit body, reserved new girl who will try to make conversations with me 

And it wasn’t like she was type of girl who will flirt and talk with every boy, she was introverted and reserved, i never noticed her talking with any boy.

But she who seemed curious about me so she will try to talk to me & strike conversation.

Like a remember an incident with kartikey

In arts period we have to move to different class section where all mix, so she sat on seat that was just ahead of me and started talking with me little.

Kartikey couldn’t tolerate it and he commented something rude, that made further conversation awkward.

KARTIKEY MAYBE FELT JEALOUSY.

BUT I WASN’T LIKE ARROGANT/BOASTFUL ABOUT THIS..

Even in that 

I was oblivious and just dismissed that as curiosity and i had really low self worth. 

Why will someone even like me? 

I am a defective and impaired person. FROM CHILDHOOD I HELD THAT BELIEF. 

I really wished i was born in different body to differnet parents or i was just orphan. ANYTHING BUT ME

  
  

 tried to recal rhink of memories, say things to myself that'll put me in hopelessness or futility of all mood.

  

People feel safer saying no.

They feel like they retain their autonomy.

I dint want to start on foundation of lies, i want the two of us to feel this as meaningful and connected.

If we lie then we won't be able to enjoy it and it will with time be harder to reveal truths.

  

If you don't feel comfortable sharing or don't want to talk about something of past.

It's okay.

Atleast for future and now

Let's be sincere and honest

  

Baat karni hain

Mujhe tumhari aankho mei dekhle baat karni hain

Khali sounds exchange Krna baat Krna thodi hota hai

  
  

For each friend ask

For how long you are friends.

When did you become friends.

How.did you become friends with them.

Are they close friend or supporting character or background character

Making piku not talking about past won't actually stop piku think.

Do something that it drops don't supresss just make it drop by giving something better in hands

  
  

Maybe vale of emotions and events have decreased cuz my inner thought and Is so reach that when world isn't engaging enough, i can enjoy there

2) to shield myself don't value.

we're lovers that have vowed our future to each other

  

Fl2 You know you are my ideal wife

Fl2 eyes shine up, she smiles, hugs mc and rubs her face in his chest as she relaxes

  

FL1 Huh! "My perfect and ideal wife." You never said something like that to me? Am i not good enough for you?

Mc - no it's not like that you are

Fl - i am ?

Crosses her hands

Mc - you wre more than just wife to me. You are my bestfriend and most trusted commadre along with being my beautiful and amazing wif e 

  

I actually never had fight where i will loose. I mean what's the point of fighting if your aren't going to win?

Yes i had friendly banters with my padosi Wale bhiya where we tried to overwhelm it wasn't hurting each other badly

Apne see choto see ldke khush holo

  

Kyu Tera khada nhi hota

  

I have so many first times to wait for and this pain will only make them sweeter but i don't work just for those reward. Those are side product.

Actually pursuing then will make me miserable

  

When i came here and didn't like place all i wanted was to run away from here.

It's difficult to put into words just how desperate I was

Anywhere but here.

I don't care nature or whatever.

Just i want to go away somewhere else.

How am I supposed to explain.

If i throw you in gutter and then i say stars are so beautiful today.

Will you think about stars? Do stars even matter.

I wanted to go away in kota but

Then i got thrown into deeper sewage that exist in my mind so this shallow sewer become insignificant.

  

Puucha nhi jaata ho jata hai

  

If i actually see an person as enemy then i will first start by sending him a letter of friendship

  
  

Tsgy- you know i felt so shame upon myself why i can't do such simple and normal thing.

  
  

All you need to know he hated and there were multiple reasons and it's complicated but

But one of the pillars behind his hatred was him thinking "i have deep rooted jealousy against him, so i poached his best-friend to satiate my jealousy"

And because of that hell always find seat back of our seat or front of us, but he will find seat.

Always wherever I go.

So this is the premide of group dynamics and my position.

  
  
  

For now let's leave it at this, if I'll tell you story it will break flow.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Kartikey and shubhankar bestfriends and cousins.

When i came, kartikey made fun g him a lot and crossed lines and auntiyo ki tarah wo jo kisi tisre inassan ki story discuss krte hain.

Pr hmesha pich bhi nhi uske muh r Bhi, Waise wo mujhe story btata tha, so overtime their friendship eroded.

  
  
  

Never become ungrateful no matter how cold blows you recieve be grateful

  

And if i

  
  
  
  

The two kartike and shubhankar were actually cousins and known each other for long time so they were like bestfriend.

Aur unhe ustime tk Mera jaisa koi pradni nhi mila.

And the dynamic between three people group and two people group is different

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Between kartikey and me, we were both very egotistical and a power hungry type of temperament.

Because we were so same in so many aspect. We fought a lot. Had lot of ego fights to try to one-up each other. 

But if i meet someone who is same as me now, there can't be any fight cause the suffering i was dept with, i can no longer hate anyone who has seen the same places i have to see.

  

Piku doens't care about choice of hole but the feeling of being taken by younhow ever you wants her

  

The voice in my head will tell me, my value, very loudly, so loud that you'll become deaf to the others voice.

The only voice that you hear is.

  

Piku- kya bnau?

Kuch aaisa bnao jo mujhe khush kre. 

(Bring a good gift for piku too)

  
  

Tum kyu gussa ho rhe hon,

Aaisa thodi hi tha me bchne ke liye tumge khayi mei Dhaka dediya.

Tum dono khai mei gire aur meri jhe bhi khichne ke koshis krte hai.

  
  
  

Kartikey the first close friend, i made in new school and actually for the first time, i got a friend whose brain is at same resonance of mine.

But problem with him was he was too competitive and bit narcissistic.

So whether we will talk about something.

For example - i remeber, i told him

"I have always felt this story sense of destiny, that amount of coincidences that happened in my life. it'll take for me to be as i am today. They all almost feel impossible. If i were to become god and guide myself. I can't repeat it.

It feels as if some stranger force of destiny guiding me."

He said to me.

He felt the same, told how he reached his present life.

But at last he added point.

He thought all this 8-9 months ago.

  

So whatever i will talk with him about this existential feelings, he will tell he have thought all thisfew months earlier than me.

  

Which slowly evolved into him saying he can read my mind.

Even though let's say i just enter class, sit down, and we haven't even talked much, he can read my mind.

Them he will laugh in

sly/mischievous way.

  

Okay lets say for me, you can read my mind. But why Shubhankar too.

  

He thought that i poached his best-friend as form of revenge.

  

He will say the team of them used to be so good friends, but now i have ruined that. Using divide and rule.

Shubhankar will agree to his words and i found that so hypocritical

You two are still alive, breathing living, in front of each other.

  

I didn't have that much verbal intelligence developer, thag i can clear the wrong view they hold.

And i just didn't knew how to dispel this miscommunication because noone taught me.

  

Aaise kbde phen kr sharam nhi aati hain.

  

Slowly slowly the sensation of fear and quivering feels bearable. The feeling and my body shaking and all those things don't go away but feeling of that terror is something i become little okay with, then i go to other people too.

  

She lowered her voice and started to talk, she does that whenever she is serious but shy about something. She told me she wanted to feel special and not like a fuck machine. She wanted a night with Bijoy as his loving wife and celebrate a first-night kind of thing with him.

  

He too was smelling her time to time and it made her aroused profoundly.

  

Gentle eyes look

  

Saree-celebrate, special days,

ShortSkirt - normal days, simple happiness enchance

  

Food is still not prepared.

You are gandi wife apne pati ko bhukha rkhti hon, mera aacha dil Han to tumhe maar ke sudharta nhi hun.

Mujhe abhi kuch khane ko chahiye.

Tum jo khilaogi, tumhe Mera dhyaan rkhna chahiye Naa?

Piku-xyss....

Kuch mitha,

Sbse bhi mithi chiz Jo Ghar mein hain

  

Someone who is warm, gentle, fuzzy must have been loved a lot growing up.

And maybe someone who is distant wanted to be loved

  
  
  

When someone compliments for be extra in skill.

Say thankyou. Don't explain trick.

Example - your vocabulary is good.

Don't explain how you did it. Just say thankyou.

  

If some relative every disrespect piku forward or backward, I'll talk to them face to face.

Never will I be so weak that i willn't standup and fight for her.

Piku is my pride, my status symbol.

I can be disrespected and laughed at but not piku.

Its my duty to fight for my pikus owner even if i get berated.

  
  

Can i pull your cheeks?

Just what creature are you?

Hmm...uh pulls piku cheee make her head move here there.

Mere gaal tight hogye hai ask piku to strech.

Piku streches.

If you want to pull someones cheek then we can bring a children into world.

Not one but lot of cute babies.

HAN PAAR TUMHaRE GAAL KHIcHNE Ki FEEliNG ALAG HAI.

  

...................................

Values

--------------------------

Piku WILL be my pride.

But i willnt disgrace her to get cheap respect and show i am so big.

Ill obviously boast about my wife but never anything that'll bring disgrace to her.

I won't be disgracing her but myself.

-----------------------------

I wasn't weak. I was never weak.

I was actually strong person with strong value system bt what they programmed into values was bunch of crap.

They filled me up with value that made me internally weak and coward.

There were no strong role models, no strong story.

Remember ayush incident.

Was it so much fun? Was the pain you would might undergone so bad that you'll push your friend off.

  

Why are all story they teach so simple minded?

Just empty, shallow words and naive concepts.

  

With anshu,

I thought i was weak i didn't standup properly and speak.

But reality was it wasn't entirely my fault.

The values and morals i was taught were weak, childish, naive.

Is it so fun that you are okay with putting in so much pain?

Will you still laugh? When she walks and sees that road.

So stupid and wuwu stories.

I can talk countless stories.

One of the stories that comes to mind was

Do you recall:

The enemy.

The part where

  

How can he bring someone who is enemy soldier to his home

and risk his whole family.

It's so morally wrong. I don't care country just the someone who is dangerous in my home.

I will burn someone alive even knowing that he have wife and children. Ill burn him alive than to bring home.

He could have just given emergency treatment and handed over. He wasn't being human

  
  
  

Devrath used to do martial art and even there went for taekowodo competition, he went to Indonesia sayad.

But problem was he was too fixated on kicks, which i don't felt did him any good.

Cuz i used to be fat and heavy weight so as long as i am protecting my face.

His kicks can make me little slower but it can't inflict any lethal or restrictive damage, if i am deliberately taking in his kicks.

And once i am closed enough that kicks don't work here anymore,

And if he still tries with his kick then there is nothing more stupid cuz as i told, i am heavier and bigger than him, its easy for me to pin him down.

  

Tumhare haath see khane see swad to aata hai pr khane ka nhi aata

  

And from there just grab neck and back and hit continuousluly on back

  

Innocent backrub leads to

You know what i am in mood for

  
  

In situation when you use brahmastra

Piku you asked me to wait till...

But what if you get swayed by emotions and i manage to convince you

  
  

FL2 is making food and it's late than the time it was supposed to be so mc hungry and groans little, fl1 comes up and says she can maybe satiate him little while they wait.

In front of FL1

  
  
  

You don't know how happy it makes you seeing & hearing you humming.

I can replay this memory countless time to make myself happy

Piku mem tumse milta nhi to Mera kya hota

Tumhe aur smile krte gungunate dekhne ke liye kya kru main?

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

In beginning tell my school was very strict and rigid about rules and lot of kids were complacent to rule.

Over small things they can even call at home to parents.

Or kids getting suspended for misconduct.

I have heard lot of stories

  
  
  

Sir asked itni hasi kyu AA rhi (english main)

Aur baki class ke bchoo nee circle bana liya jàaise zoo ke janwar ko sb dekh rhe hain.

  

Mene phir see sir nicche Kiya kii sir marlo na kyu aaisa drama, kyu kr rhe ho maaro aur khatam kro

  

sir ne pucha whats so funny?

  

Meri hasi ab ruk gyi

  

Mene bola sir see - pichee see bche hasa rhe thee.

Lamest excuse. Zero creativity.

Mene halka explain Kiya ki hm dono khde thee shubhankar and me piche see bche hasane lgee

  

Jb mene upaar mud kr dekha to mene realise Kiya sir actually me mujhe genuinely sun rhe hai.

  

Aur mujhe realise hua sir mujhe respect type see dekhte isliye mere words me actually more weight hain than i imagine.

Isliye sir nee mujhe bhi maarna start nhi kr diya aur genuinely sun rhe hain.

  

Sir nee pucha kon bche thee.

  

Ab mujhe pta hai mere words me weight hai to mujhe soch kr bolna hai

  

Mene bola kartikey aur devansh aur undono namuno ki tarf dekha jo hmare pichee baithte thee,

  

Wo dono abhi tk daat dikha kr hs rhee thee

Aur wo scene just comical tha ki kaise wo Suddenly just bokhla gaye

  

Aur wo dono sir sir yee woo

Unka dimag haywire hogya wo mujhe dikh rha tha aur dono hi bol rhe thee aur explain kr re thee sir ko

HOW THIS TRADEGY took place and HOW ITs MY MIsTAKe

  
  

Mee bs yee expression apne face pr maintain kr rha tha

Ki tum dono yee kya baate kr rhe ho? Me to class me bhi nhi tha jb yee sb hua jo yee tum kahani hol Rhee ho?

Muh nhi khola, jaroorat nhi thii Mee bs dekh rha tha.

  

Sir nee hm dono kee bich me dekha

Unhe bich Mee hi rok diya jb wo baat kr rhe thee aur mujhe pucha tum btao kya hua.

  

I wasn't prepared with a lie story.

So i tried to play off

Ki sir hamara ldko wali backchodi kr Rhee thee aur yee Puri class kee samne bolna appropriate.

I can't speak in front of class.

  

Sir nee pucha ki Mee bolu kya baat thi.

  

Sir yee ashlel baate kr rhe thee.

  

Me bolne wala thaa pr bola nhi kyuki abhi tk mujhe ek bhot bigger problem side of brain mei CHL rhi thii

  

Shubhankar! Jo jamin pr abhi bhi dharashaai thaa.

Me indono ko pitwadu aur khud abhi bch jau.

Wo sir ko uth kr boldega,

Aur end me mera lie expose hoga.

Pr aaisa nhi hai ki mei hopeless hu.

Me phele see sir ko koi aaisi story bol skta hu ki jisme yee tino mujhe bully type kr rhe thee.

Aur agar Mee yee story sir ko phele feed krunga, jisse phele shubhankar inke saath forces join krta Hain mein bch jaunga

  

Pr phir Mee apni value break kr rha hunga.

Kartikey ko 9th class wala agrim ek Ganda isaan Soni am just delivering justice to him.

Pr shubhankar and in that moment memories were flowing in mind of incident where kartikey and shubhankar were laughing and making fun of one-two kids and it was verbal bullying.

So maybe he deserve it.

But in my mind i know i am trying to fool myself so in the

Even for kartikey i felt i was doing a bad thing little but i said to myself justice.

  

This big dialogue (moral conflict) i just said i was thinking all of this in back of kind ever since,

Kartikey dewansh bokhlague thee aur sir ko explain kr Rhee thee.

Mei tb see hi yee soch rha tha.

  

I didn't knew what to do. But i can't betray my friend, so i just did what come naturally to me.

  

Pr phele mene abhi present topic change Kiya.

Sir joke puch rhe hain.

Lets change topic and get some control

I started to rant in front of sir, how kartikey in sst class was piche see Marni ki kosis kr rha tha, chuti kaata hai, aur baki ussne kaisi pressan kiyaa Aaj throughout school, hm dono seat bdlne ki koshis krte hai pr wo piche aajata hain.

Halka falsify and exaggerate krke.

  

When i eneded sir was looking between me and kartikey.

I didn't knew if my lie was convincing enough

  

Sir was looking between us.

Sigh.

I know i was loosing so just doing the last fight i can do.

  
  

I turned towards shubhankar i was ready that i will go to him.

And shake him ask him in anger and aggressive tone.

Kartikey wo 4th period mei hme preshan kr rha tha,

Hana.

(Hopefully wo Han kh dega aur sir usse proof manlebge.)

  

I don't know.

Mera luck kharab hain.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Sst

-Story is long

-First let me give you little background so you can enjoy the story

And introduction to setting and character

1) sir from kerela, Goa, tamilnadu, Karnataka something like that, talk in english

2)  real struggle keep wake up, accent

One time i was sitting on middle row, front seat and there too, i slept for 4-7min.

I don't know if sir noticed

3) case wasn't same with whole class.

Class would be laughing, lively, joking with sir.

I would be struggling to wake up.

4)Aur yee kafi nhi thaa, to jo mere side me mera mitr SHUBHANKAR baitha tha.

Wo bhot funny aur charming personality thi, aur ven in 100 people group he will stand out.

5) saare teacher use maarte thee pr pasand bhi krte thee.

To class mein sir kee saith banter aur joke krne ki frontline pe tha, to agar mei Sona bhi chahu chupkee see so nhi skta thaa,

6) bohot baar me usse sst period me chod kr kisi aur kono mei chupne jaata tha.

+++----++++

7)Okay now the other animal.

Who behind me kartikey.

Kartikey believed - poached bestfriend jealous

Yes he is a pig, i can hunt and poach

Wont leave me and sit behind or front of me to annoy me and take out his bitterness. Annoying.

-if i try to explain full context it will break tone so lets leave it at that.

  

.

------------

Now let's start the story

0) i moved from sleepy to hungry

1) i would have eaten my lunch but i was sitting on side(use fingers to show)

2) if take out some chugalkhor kid will start doing sir sir

3) i endure bells ring

Reliveed

4)takes lunch out

5) Yet everyone else stands up

6) class serious

Look around - noone talking or trying to talk to other, or supressig happiness

7) PURE SILENCE AND SERIOUSNESS.

I put my lunch back

8) low voice talk

  A) looked at me tumhe nhi pata

Obviously

  B) subhe announcement Hui to thi- me khoya khoya insaan hun, to announcment hui bhi hogi to mene dhyaan nhi diya hoga.

   C) gandhiji maar gye!

I said to myself

Gandhiji mar gyee sigh

9) Gandhiji

My mind started producing memes of Gandhi

  
  
  

Bachpan mei mujhe chipkali see bhot drr lgta tha kyuki ek do baar wo mujh pr gir gyi thee.

To isliye uske naam hi email krdiya

  
  

Mene baat mani thi mummy ki, me kuch din nhi baitha, pr apni biradri ka koi aur Mila nhi

  
  

5th class beggining

Wo last person thi jisse me chahunga Kunal complain kre.

Mere dimag ke switch flip hue aur mene usse bola

Kya hogya, mujhe dikhao.

Aao Kunal reception chlte hai,

Pr wo utha nhi.

Mene bola thik ha kaam see bleeding to rok lo rumal see.

Usne koi reaction nhi diya.

Yee loo Mera rumal

Bs uss khon ko pocho

  

Mene utne pyaar see kbhi nhi bola hoga, but sb kuch itne naturally as rha tha.

Pr wo seat see nhi uthaa

  

It was new school, i barely new names and faces, and i don't remeber who i smack in face.

  

Yee sb problem nhi hoti ahgar wo pyaar see man jata aur reception chlta.

Pr uske dil Mee achai aur kindness ki koi kimat hi kha tha

  

Music, dance, games ka syaad period thaa.

Mera bestfriend tha jo responsible thas class Mai kon rukega uske liye.

Me hi hamesa ruk jata thaa.

Rudra bhi niche nhi jana chahta tha to wo bhi class Mai baith gaya.

Mene rudra ko bola

Agar koi teacher dikha

Good morning bolna

Aur jakar aache see jhukr paar chuho, haath see yee kro.

Phir see goodmorning sir bolna aur sir jhukana.

Teacher nhi rokega.

Kyuki wo baat hai na ki agar

Tum let's say show me lot of respect then i willnt do an action that may break that

Aur waise bhi tecaher ko bcche respect nhi krte, to unke liye bhi thida refreshing hoga

  

Class5 age- begin-10 end-11

10yrs Kunal incident

I was shy and coward kid, meri kbhi himmat nhi hogi wo bhi naye school Mai ki mei reception to jau, pr apne dost ko trouble mei dekh kr mujhe duniya ki sari courage aagayi.

  

Obviously usse pta tha me kya game khel rha hun

Aur mei bhi subtle nhi tha.

  

Mujhe abhi tk chahre aur naam shi see yad nhi tha, (no need to say again I'm new in school) aur me jyada drunk tha chehre aur naam yaad rkhne kee liye.

  

Stone throwing 6-8yrs

  
  

1)Sir aaye shubhankar aur usse Marne lgee.

2)Sir ussse maare hi Jaa rhe aur wo bhi àaise 

3) 5--6sec paas hue Mai apni chance ka wait kr rha hu.

4) Sir nhi rukeme ka naam nhi Lee rhe 

5) aur wo ab aaise act kr rha tha ki usne mata chd gyi.

6) pagalo ki tarah hasna, ajib angles pee mudna

7) 1 min paas hua, hss kr mere Peet me drd ho rha tha, pr hsi nhi ruk rhi thi.

8) mee yee soch rha thaa ki sir ko jb realise hoga asli culrpit kon hai to Mera kya haaal hoga

9) ab tk class kee bcho nee ek circle bna liya aur sb dekh Rhee thee jaise wo circus meein aaye hai,

10) aur ek pig ko mar khate hu dekh, Haas Haas kr uski aakhe itni bdi hogi thi

.

  

Mera number aaya, meri hasi abhi tk nhi ruki

Sir ask what's funny

I know, my future is not so bright. STILL i have to protect my dignity,

But my laughing won't stop.

  

Thing is that when lot of people are involved then one single person won't get that strict punishment and call at all home

Maybe i can DILUTE MY SINS.

First aim was to just create story messy

  

-keep story vague like till now, ki you know, sir punish everyone

- and now needle is shifting to place where all blame is on kartikey

Jo actually mujhe help nhi krega

Kyuki kartikey ki pitne ke bad my friend jo dharasahi hokar pda hai usne forces join krke bta Diya too I WILL LOOSE.

Maybe i can frame my words such that sir uske words ko bhi koi value nsa deee but phir uska matlab Mee usse betray krunga Jo me kr nhi skta aur meri wajah see wo pita hai to mujhe thoda bura bhi lg rha thaa.

To Mera mind thoda blank ho rha thaa,

I am still smiling playfully

If all [was.in](http://was.in/) Hindi, maybe i can spin conversation a little, in English where i am translating Hindi to English. Me khud ki beezati krwa rha hunga.

I said sir piche see poke kr rhe thee, after that i tried to shift conversation by saying that they were annoying distrubing us in sst period and we ( me and shubhankar) ask them to go sit somehowere else but they keep annoying is.

  

Me abhi normal tone mei ek baar mei bol diya, pr aasi situation Mai jaha mujhe words nhi aa rhe hai aur Mee aatak kee bol rha hun.

Mujhe nhi pta mere words ka kya effect hua. Aur. Mujhe embarasmrnt feel ho rhi thi thodi.

  

Pr pr tbhi sir nee hmari dono ki seat pee dekha uspr pen ki cap ulti rkhi Hui thi, sir nee cap uthai aur pucha yee kiski.hai.

  
  

Lively playful person, money isn't the metric that job and success is female thing

  

ng and

Second option-

  

Sir preesed me for answer.

It's difficult to answer an direct question vaguely morever when i am translating Hindi to English then speak so

  
  
  

Remember eternal boredom since childhood you thought it'd disappear in future that time never came, human world is boring very less to offer, not your fantasy world.

You have to create a beautiful world of your own no reasom to bow for world that won't offer you anything

Perhaps i am the one to blame, not the people who surrounded me. They weren't at fault. It was me. Doens't mean i am broken. No compass is ever broken, it always point somewhere maybe not the direction where other humans intends it to be, but it always does oint somewhere.

I have to craft the right direction for me the path that will lead me to place where i will like o be.

  

I was thinking of 

Word - Nature

1.  Nature = Innate Quality.
    

We think nature as earth nature

Nature and the concept of "Mother Earth" are often used interchangeably in our society, but this view may be flawed. We are taught that the world's innate quality is nature and that humans are being too arrogant to think they are beyond it. However, if we consider the true nature of the world and its history, the reality is quite different. The world's environment was once inhospitable to life, with oceans containing too much iron to support it. It was only through the evolution of cyanobacteria  forms that the oxygen content increased and oxidised the iron, making it habitable. When we look at other planets and beyond our solar system, we see that nature as we know it on Earth is not a universal phenomenon. The true nature of the world is hostile to life and is in fact anti-nature

2.  Nature = 
    

HOW IT IS PORTRAYED THAT NATURE IS STRONG & DOMINEERING FORCE. Humans are weak they should know their place. 

Only humans have chance to spread it to other planets’, protect from meteors, and other dangers which nature is too weak to space

  

3.  Nature & Pollution
    

We call our sewers polluted but aren’t they place where lot of bacteria and animals thrive.

nALL=-ve connotation

YET BECAUSE IT’S LETHAL FOR Majority we CALL Their habitat “Polluted”

And we SAY IT NEGATIVELY AFFECT nature which is evaluated on basis of majority's evolution.

What if in an alternate universe if drinking sewage water extended lifespan and cured many diseases will humans still call it polluted won't they would call it as drink that taste bad but it will be good (A MEDICINE)

Religion- WINE OF GOD

 Krishna ji naali ka paani chori krenge

  

Earth and other beings don't give fuck about order. The balance only exist because they can use each otehr withoutgetting in way HTOSE WHO RESUSED TO ALIGN WILL be killed eventually.

Other beings evolution just haven’t caught up yet. If we give may1000yrs they can evolve and new diversity of species can come which thrive in new climate

Somya launched an SATYAGRAHA

What makes Pooja mam different from other teachers was 
They got beaten from kids of class and me too, they weren't brutal.
HER INTUITION She was strong intution user.
With devrath case she wasn't looking at me but whole system as unjust.
That's why i felt that STRONG DETACHED INTUTION USER untouched by emotion and can peer into secrets and reality that's not spoken.
Mam defend me and didn't listened to her and other kids too were rasing noise for fun.
So uhh... I felt mam and how she saw me.

Arrogance Intution pseduo false fake self serving.
Suyash and Kartikey 
Not reffering to that ego lifting see themselve people who just see other as naive & stupid instead of actually seeing them.
The false intution and intelligence i see like in kartikey and suyash are self-upping type and its not even intution just they find opportunity to prance.
They arent actually seeing what they are seeing.
They just miss last layer of humanity.
They don't see the last layer it's their ego that covers it.
Example - suyash telling stroy of how boy wrote on.. and he thinks of himself as smart & he lacks sensitivity too.
Their assuming themselves as superior is what makes them weak and even their goodness is out of 
of
oh how was you are here take some money and blanket.

It must get really cold here hope this blanket will help.
 Just 
First one assume themselves as something beyond something stronger than cold they are too big for cold to touch them

Imagine of a story where both are used
The execution, the destruction and aftermath 
If nulear bomb 
Vs 
Brahmastra 
Brahmastra is much more dreamy,
.s

Guns say machine gun

Vs 

Holy sword which has this history and this mythology and this saying




Social order - evil billionares, corrupt burecrats, goverment official
Vs
Maybe tyrant ruler, a minister who is scheming to throw the king away



How will we have superbabies if you can't do one ___


Guns, missiles just don't feel dreamy



Jb tum budhi ho jaugi tb bhi meri tumhe uthaunga 
Pause and stop and think

Aur uske baad 4-5 bchee khde ho gyee 
Jinhe mei nhi phechanta bhi nhi thaa

Sorry tumhe ek chiz chuz karni hai.

Aur mujhe pta thaa physical fight see hi resolve hoga 
Pr hm ldege to koi jitega nhi kyuki hmme  body size aur strength me jayda difference nhi hain.
Kyuki uske liye dusre insaan ko  overpower krna pdta hain
Zamin pr niche pin krke.
Ya bs ek dusre ko maro unil ek insaan out of pain quit nhi krdeta, usme bhot hi explosive arrogance thaa to wo pain see give up nhi krega.

Do you know ennegram types.

You don't sit until piku is situated.
Search on how to do it without it being awkward 

I now understand why they had reverence against apoorv.
They saw apoorv at sanik school exam and other exams where they were too and he didn't tell them and with white lie play it off.
I always was angry when they made fun of apoorv because battle was one sided cause they have group identity and it's one sided.
It's cheating. Making joke about him 
So maybe since i have most internal power in the group if i went with him theyll stop which they did but saw it as my betayl and the two reunited again and i thought will leave us but sit behind us.
I was confused whole time and didn't understand what to do.
I lacked intelligence to make a bend.


Tum aaise bologi tu mera aur ulta hi kaam krna kaa mn krega

About destiny
Depends on defination
I think you can say it does exist cause just think of just think of how many conincidences have to be there for us to meet.
How many conincidences for me to be the way i am 
And how many conincidences for the one who is listening to be way he is.
I don't think if i had power to bend fate i would be able to replicate that
We can even go back more in time and say so so so so many coincidences have to happen grandparents ----> their grandparents and all their richness --> earth formation --> universe formation ......



Dualistic Perspective 
Mutual exploitation and Mutual thriving are just two aspects duality
.
We can even say destiny don't exist,  and not love just all typee or relationship all are kind of barter system. Where individual barter things with other. 
Reason why i am talking to you and you may still be listening 
If we look in full intricately aren't same we are deriving different type of flux from all this.
But whatever it maybe we find that whatever is getting fluxed is worth getting fluxed so a bond is formed to keep regular supply
And source of conflict, is you aren't getting the supply you expected subconsciously or Consciously.
And since both party actually never tell each other or themselves with full truth what they are exploiting the differences may remain
The truth remains masked from both eyes since they are playing some fanatsy role that they learned how to play through other humans and media.




Mujhe tumhare baare mein sooche Bina nind nhi aati mei hmesha hr raat ko tumhe yaad krte hue hi sota hun, sir din mei nhi, aur jb nind nhi aati hai tb bhi tumhe hi soch kr soone ko koshis krta hun.
Really main addicted hai 

You know my friends are jealous of me for having you.

None of my friends have relationsip like ours

Develop and Preserve the respect and resistance towards saying No 
Encourage and thank after every request 
And occasionally, time to time tell her. "I really love you, you have hardly ever denied, there were sometimes little resistance but you did what i have requested and ask of you to do. Thankyou"
I too will do anything you ask of me 
 
Have more compassion towards fellow men

Show you still have hope. You haven't given up. Follow vedant bhiy and prince jpm
Berate yourself so people don't have expectation and you can be atleast relieved of always fighting.
If lady luck knows your door then you can just 😁
YOU NEEDN'T FEEL LOW YOU ARE ALREADY BEYOND 90% M. And 80% fem you can super easily get, that will be glad to have you or maybe god happy. 
NATURE see then think BEFORE FEELING Miserable 
Old age ag and dead all see.
Prospects of smart whmen exist who don't seem to find anyone wise enough 
However In some situation you can't berate yourself 
Then say koi bhi bs aaisi hi gf thodi hi chahiye utni simple equation nhi hain.

Scheme how to smoother graph from stupid silly talks to deep conversation where you learn depth
You made mistake of directly asking prince story when there was no mood or chemistry. Mood and chemistry is extremely important.

I have money stories of monkey attacking.

The story of us ending playing game stopped when we discovered a worm
2)  Jeep which we turn into our base 6-7-8-9 years old
Hamari gang
Decorating it with seekh, jhado,  
And doing party in it 

3) hide and seek monkey army


4) Arpit game play of drama. It was one of my favourite games when we used to play it.
Age-6,7,8,9
Else played only sometimes they were too big for game like this.
But yo me it felt like pretentious and fake.
Cuz i managed to coax them into playing when it was only two or three then there l was no shyness but in front of whole group.
They want to protect their fragile egos.
 

5) monkey entered class and ate lunch i

Age: 6-8
Mei arpit ki kyari(garden) or it wasn't garden just soil with nothing much, pr crouch hokar story plan bna rha thaa
Stories mei generally Mera ek plan hoga ussne phir arpit apne suggestion dega.

Aur boss kon honge.
Aur hm dono hi thee to hm dono multiple characters play krte thee switch kreke
To mei arpit ko pura plan waise hi ungli see ground me khich kr bta rhu hun.
Usne bola agrim bandar
Dekho mei abhi bolne ke bich me thaa aur me game ke liye bhot passionate bhi thaa to, 
Mene uski baat seriously nhi lii aur mei usse story hi bta rha thaa niche dekh kr.
Pr ubhot time see uska koi reaction nhi aaya to mujhe realise hua wo mujhe nhi sun rha hain.
To mei bs khda ho rha dekhne kee liyeee kee yee kyu itna drama kr rha hain
Mujhe koi khas dar nhi tha merale dimag Meri story thii pr
 ki just middle mei uthne kee 
Mujhe apne sir pr kuch soft aur warm saa feel hua.
Meri body instinctively freeze hogyi.
Mei dra nhi tha, me bs lock hogyi uss hi position main and all that i was speaking so much passion and  that all it just dropped and my mind was in full clear
Me hlka saa aur upar utha aur Puri force see niche push kiya
Bandar gira taapa khaya
Aur ulta hogya aur meri tarf khiiiiii krke dekh rha thaa.
Me bhi pura khda hogya thaa.
To hm dono aankhe ldaa rhaa thee 
Aur wo ek trance like state thi meri body.
Mere dimag mee zero thoughts thee aur mera pura focus monkey pee thaa
Aur monkey ka bhi pura dhyan sirf mujh pr thaa.
Pr uss khubsurat Shanti ko ek arpit ki chiik nee barbad kiya.
Arpit yha see(tell where arpit was and how distance little idea)
Arpit apne Ghar pee gate pr tha jo bnd thaa to uspr hi thaa aur wo chola pda

Actually abhi jb bandar gira to wo thoda arpit kee paas tha, abhi bhi duri dono mei compare kree too bandar meere paas jayda thaa aur usse safe distance pr peeth dikha kr thaa.

Ab banadr nee muh kr arpit ki taraf dekha, me instinctively hi piche aur piche hone lga.
Pr jb bandar nee arpit ko dekh kr 
Khiiiii Kiya to arpit bhagne lga.

Touching out of blue
Breast squeeze no wrong 
Butt slap - out of blue nice but not in front and this is probelm is that in breast squeeze you will be like a puppy/dog since you are looking in eye and doing it.
Whereas in butt slap you do our of blue and suprise- you show authority here.

If you have to breast squeeze don't it directly unnaturally
Carress her like a small animal.
Carress her arms legs, stomach, graze callher breast but you are doing to small animal.
But gradually you acn increase lustful nature in it.


---------------
Aacharya Prashant saying on Babu baby was kind of misrepresentation.

He is talking words too literally.
When saying Babu baby it's to represent the emotion you feel in your body 
And it's kind of same emotions that you feel holding a baby and taking care of it 
Words just represent the feeling and emotion that you feel when when interacting with cute baby.
So you temporarily enter that state.
There is nothing wrong with any emotional state it's something natural and necessary.

And i hardly doubt that people always talk in that language 
Saying Babu and that is conversation you have time to time when you are in mood and enjoy.
I don't think doing it 24x7 without talking about anything else would be fun. 

Not sleeping with anyone Aacharya Prashant
I think sleeping sometimes together will increase the specaillness of the act than making it new normal by doing it daily as it will become too familiar. 
But we have to maintain right order between familiarity and specialness.
Soemthing special make it worthwhile to look forward in future, hope and dream.
But it's not good when you have is all hope and dreams.
And I believe sleeping together should be good thing to be familiar with.
We can make it special by talking different thing on special day, dining different, sleeping at different place in different position than normal.

It was kartikeys personality along with he must be big fish in pond.



Jeep let me describe it to you. It's difficult but it was first of all a jeep.
The behind area was open, like window it doesn't close it was just like that. Liek the one you see in movie jisme terrorist/police ldee hote hai piche.
Hm usshi space mei see andar baahar Jaa skta thee
Combine with fact we were all small 5-6 yr old, so it was really big and spacious for us.
One time me together we decide we will party.
We decroated the truck from inside   
Seekh aur mujhe utne aache see yaad nhi pr 
Hmne usse decorate Kiya thaa apna aada bnaya tha, 
Aur sb 10-10rs laaye thee aur usse ikahata krke party ki

Ab mujhe yaad hai, mere side mei exam me ek ladki baithi thi dusri class ki.
Mene apni pencil see uski pen wali pencil (lead put).
Mujhe pen wali pencil chahiye to mene exchange ki baat ki.
I don't know mene kaise convince Kiya pr uske baad see mujhe drr lga rhta thaa ki 
Uske bade bhaiye ya mummy papa ko pta chlega mene usse ullu bnaya hai to meri bhot pitayi hogi.
Exam to sayad jaldi khatam hogye pr exam kee baad me apne padosi bhiya didi ke saath ek dance competition dekhne gaya thaa mere pados Wale bhiya perform krenge.
Wha pr bhi wo thii, NO! Me khush hua tha Jaan bchiii pr kyu.)

And changed to stanford 


School fight advantage.
I was the biggest/tallest category combined with i have more of an wide-frame

I have strong sense g destiny that how much lucky i have to be in this state compared to all other state i could have been.
Do i belive in that sense of destiny but It's torch is towards past in future i don't know.

Soul mate- i don't believe as an law of universe. That is universal
 but you can go into a meaning state that you sincerely feel it subjectively that soulmate exist.
But not as universal law. Just as an personal experience
Add
The universal and the personal needn't be same, even if universe dictates personal so universal is more reliable for prediction but isnt it the personal that matters.
A person may believe world ends after he died and maybe it is true cause the world he calls world will disappear in sense.

Suppose with piku you have to talk such that events collides for you it requires you to tell first kiss.
First kiss - no i got kissed by surprise, i was small and didn't have brain in 9th, i don't consider it my official first kiss. 
You are the first one

Maybe if not maindish we can do other things, but i willnt pressure or force you until you feel comfortable and develop trust for me.


When thanking piku.
Thank piku for the effort and emotions with which it was made even if food isn't good or you are disappointed say thanks for efforts
Non-verbal ways - kissing on cheeks, smiling while you eat as you look at her.

In childhood for long time i thought he was punished by god because he didn't inform me of the emergency of situation and slipped near to his door and only said to me once agrim monkey.

However it maybe that the reason arpit screamed maybe monkey is about to attack me and he don't know what to do? 
(So in a sense it was out of care for me?)
Maybe maybe
I don't know? I never asked? I can't know now.

I want to know though 6-7 years child kee head pr bandar baith hua kaisa lgega

Shubhankar thodi behti hawa ke jhoke jaisa thaa

When i saw alok sir, i was relieved.
He was class-teacher but he never wa spresent in ptm earlier, first time r came.
In 1st period kids were not that charged up & stiff and everyone was silent. I didn't had nothing to worry about since i didn't do anything.

Bhiyas laughing on Rahul bhiya for rakhi from gf but reflection.
He should have said 
"Tumhe.mhi.samajh aayga, tumhari pyaari .. masumiyat aur pyaar see tumhe rakhi bandhna chahiye aur tum bologe ki me km mard ho jaunga. Tumhe pyaar Krna nhi aata"





Rudra was chalu person lot.times in situation we got for something.
He will just say agrim started that or he did this in serious and non-emotional cold tone obviously he is right, kind of offended.
I was always able to counter and just ask him playfully "whose idea was to...?" "Who do you think wanted to do...?" 
Bhot baar wo bhi hasne lg jayga thoda aur bhot baar maar jayga.
I don't have exact words in memories i ahve forgotten.

However there were many incident when he shifted blame on me when i wasn't there with just him.
That way i had no chance of win.
Like coc incident and other i have forgotten but i remain frustration, anger, humilation.

Rudra was kid of science teacher who was everyone's favourite teacher and in.groups i used to.hang around with (robotics and science Olympiad) mam was head.
So there all kids were sucking upto her.
in that situation they have power to isolate me.
So i have to be in limit and confront rudra in a way without doing so much that i feel resistance.


Your fault was you were too reserved..not only you need to establish friendship in one to one but in group dynamic rise to power by talking lead more.
Do it while everything is in kind of raw uncooked phase since everyone is kind of shy, you can step outside from that.

I think harsh and daksh was one of best friend from their sides atleast, but i didn't valued them, i should have.


Tumhari to do-tiin jagah setting hogi.


With devrath incidents and fights i think I could have easily been a tyrant.
It was my mom words that held me. And prevented me but later i resorted on trying to get a ath of being a tyrant but on 1st step sumo said to me it's not right there was no reason for brutality over small thing.
Oh God! I was an intuitive genius only if they haven't brainwashed me with their petty 



............( Don't tell you part of rudra story to other )

The reason why rudra left is also an interesting, a complex and nuanced.
But let me give a brief summary of sorts 
Monika mam, was a famous teacher and she was favourite of most of our class students. Meri bhi thii.. rudra see dosti see phele.
Now her child comes, on first day she introduces me to him and told me to be his friends.
He was a person who had too much energy aur just pagalo ki tarah hste rhna
In beginning i thought it will be fun with him, he was like me intrested in maths and science we can talk a lot, class me padhne Wale bache hi nhi thee

With time i realised that
Meri memory fuzzy hai so i will say wherever will come in my brain 
but

He had very egoistic and entitled personality
He bragged a lot about visiting America few times uske koi relative work krte thee waha pr
Wo usko lekar sbke samne bhot jhadta thaa 
So he has himself as an elite species of human whereas others were normal?

In competition school koi bhi
Like maybe best out of waste r poster making
He will bring Mam's and will use that to make things.
He will bring material which maybe considered not allowed 
But his mom was the coordinator and judge of competitions too.
And he got 1st place in almost most of the competiton and everyone saw tha as unfair.

So his name degraded a lot in front of our class kids but still there were lot of kids who will like to swarm.around him since they all like Monika mam so he was kidn f okay but with time 

Like i said he had an entitled and egoistic perosnlaity so it hurted his ego that kids dare to make jokes about him and act like this to him

A lot of kids still used to swarm around him time to time because e was still kid of one of favourite teachers of all.

I am not saying things in order sorry you are smart you can organise things in your brain.

Aur actually wo brag krta thaa pr sbke saath kind of theek hi behave krta thaa 
.
Story of how Slowly i started to develop kind of dislike towards him.
.
Start with hs mom, Monika mam, she actually was head of all activities i was part of.
She used to teach me and my friend Kunal in assembly time earlier for Olympiads and in robotics she was kind of overseeing, tecaher for robotics came from outside but basically she was kind of an key actor in my life. 
Now with rudra problem comes
...
Rudra was friendly too all but he saw me as kind of competition,  
He wasn't friendly to me for some reason just me.
he will try to make his group laugh by degrading jokes at me and i was okay i too will just be throw friend insult at him but he was entitled and egotistical so he will easily get angey and will say false things to mam that i did or say.

Diaper- he may act high and mighty but he is just a kid who still wears diaper cuz his tantrums and arrogance felt childish




""""""
Like tha vice-principal sir incident i told, do you think normal person will just talk like that and even not that why were the charts covering the window? 
Because rudra saw as an who they think they are to just look? 
An arrogant type of anger, that those.people are kind of insect so they aren't allowed to see.
Plus 
He bragged a lot about having visited America once and his uncle is in America.
In classes with monika-mam, he will talk then ask her to we did that right, Monika mam will explain.
""""’





When i looked up at sir i felt maybe he willnt hit me unless situation coerces him to. Maybe that's why he didn't hit me.

Class4th 9years something 
Mere bag mei poche mqli chain mei , khi niche mujhe mehnge pen mile.
Instead of asking whose pen is this i just looked around and focused on kid and then got up used opportunity and slid up pen in his bag.
Next period mam and sister came.

One time, they started checking and my bag has pen when i dig my hands and i knew i can't be like.
I don't know mere bag me pen kaha see aagya.
So i just sipped it into bottle holder place of bag, in bag of kid behind me.
Ab jb piche wali ki chance aayi mujhe bura LG rha thaa, rpr unhone bottle Wale usme to check hi nhi kiya.


Kartikey belived
1) poaching 
2) actual story has more dimensions
3) mujhe yee chiz samjh nhi aayi ki
Tumhara dost yhi pr hain uske saath jitna sambhog Krna hai tum kr skte hon.
Mujhe kyu ghusa.rhw ho


Story is complicated i don't want to get into it now.
But kartikey had very narcissistic and had insensitive & rude personality . But he could act nice.



So for fun and amusement with me he will amke fun of shubhankar and 
Berate him to get pleasure out of it, and enjoy basically which ended up diving him and shubhankar.
2) mind-reading
Like i would be standing and suppose i look around look at him and just smile.
-he will tell me what i am thinking.
Not only me he can only read shubhankar's mind.
Mera hi dimag hi nhi wo SHUBHANKAR KA dimag bhi pdh skta thaa saath mein.

Actually jis way mei bol rha hun usse wo sayad chutiya de khayi dee
Pr actually wo highly intelligent tha with observant personality but observant to things that proved his superiority or threatens it.


 



Mei usse dekh kr hss bhi nhi skta tha kyuki wo kitna serious thaa apne judgements mein

In situation of getting caught rudra try to push it on me to talk way out but teachers knew him so they will interrogate only him.








Practical physics.
I gave him my pen use it so colour won't differ, asked him to do from back so we can do parallely.
I was touched. He is doing it for some stranger instead of having fun with his friends and it's not going to give him anything any typw of amusement or what?
Maybe stranger won't even remember him?
I never asked for his name nor i remember his face.
Continuing the story, i started to remember that in childhood how we had an writting book, sulekh type book, you have to complete and i used to do it together with my bestfriend outside his house.
So my mind flipped happy
-saw
- same thing with sakhi
- can get out of anything any situation. not chalaki but kind of confidence but shift into blunt cold attitude that becomes so strong that you can let punish it.
Teacher knew it but they couldn't do anything. 
 I was terrified whole time and i was struggling to contain my emotion that teacher would realise we are guilty easily from my expression.

- mei hi chutiya hun

Shubhankar even accepted that i destroyed their friendship.
I actually wanted him to stand for himself.



Mom defended me in front of sir that i am very introverted ladka hun i can't act like that.

Kartikey and shubhankar i was angry they have shifted whole blame on me. And they should have recieved punishment.

With ayush and kartikey and rudra i always supress resentment


Help out of tribal feeling.


Mera ghar 
Bareilly see 20-25km duur khi sunsan ilake mein hai, wha pr bhot saare Bandar rhte hain.


Now after that Gandhi  many things happened time passed.
Kartikey grew more annoying and i wanted to go somewhere else. The only reason i was with two since i didn't have anyone else in class i clicked with.

Now now there was guy named. apoorv they kind of saw him that he considered himself better than them that's why he bhevave the way he do. Like in sanik school or Olympiad exam when they asked if he will participate he denied yet he was there in exam and just acted dumb in front of them.
He was maybe in aakash coching foundation.
He sat alone and didn't really mingle with just anyone.
They will that's why try to make fun of him, or in between class make jokes so that class will laugh on him, it made me angry.
It's cheating how just by having more number apoorv words won't have strength.
But they aren't kind of one to improve.
Apoorv showed no reaction neither positive or negative.
I decided that i will now sit with him.
Kartikey and shubhankar ultimate betrayal and they United together to fight against this.
We used to sit in 3rd row then in 2nd
They tried and tried to poke fun buu now dynamic has shifted
But now their words and insults lost significance, 
because the power dynamic at sit in that group, they will be the jokes for trying to make jokes.



Now on my gorup other two people ayush and akshat bhiya were unwilling. Why because the two had dynamic it grinning at stupidity. They were okay to express it when it was just me or me and arpit 


Kha bhiya maths ki equation hi solve kri hai

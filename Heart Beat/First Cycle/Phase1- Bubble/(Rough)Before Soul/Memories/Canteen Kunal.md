# Canteen Kunal 

One of the most fun thing in Class 5ht WAS CANTEEN AND KUNAL. I saw canteen for first time in STANFORD AND I was just SO EXCITED AND HAPPY.

First we used to buy 2CNS 5x2=10rs) 

IT FELT SO COOL AND SCIFI THINGY, I WAS BUYING ANYTHING I LIKE. I LOVED BREAD PAKODA THE MOST.

One time in week, i will get 10rs and kunal will also bring 10rs randomly so whichover of us bought something we will buy it and share that thing and eat it together, it was FUN

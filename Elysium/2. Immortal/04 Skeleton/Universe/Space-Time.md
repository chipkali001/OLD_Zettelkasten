#Space-Time 
A world in itself is an isolated entity. AETHER is what made the world (SOLAR SYSTEM + REALMS ) in first place.

Reversing Time OF INORGANIC>ORGANIC>>>>>>>SOULS (AETHER or INFINITE MANA)

AETHER+Space-Time MAGIC TIME REVERSE ON PLANNET = PAST-PRESENT or Futre-PresentMERGE
Now if person casting spell want people of both time to be alive then he will have to use AETHER to bring souls back OTHERWISE there would onlt be corpse of past/future people.
If same person two version existed REINCARNATION/LONG_LIFE, one body will die, memory merge  (Uncalculable)

Space-Time MAGIC TIME REVERSE ON PLANNET = NO MERGING but souls of those who who didn’t belonged in that time in that region over which magic was cast will die instnat, and soul of those who are beyond region over where magic cast but belonged to time their body will be hollow body THEY WILL LIVE PEACUL IN BEYOND REGION.
If same person two version existed REINCARNATION/LONG_LIFE, one body will die, memory merge (Uncalculable)


Ease of reversing time depends on 
Time Past & Isolation Of place where event happened 
coin toss or slipping or “death few min ago in battle” “Cat killed in isolated space for 1000s year” =SUPER EASY REVERSIBLE

WHAT NORMAL TIME MAGIC DO IS - Reverse particles and thigs to it’s old orientation - WORLD KNOWS IT’S ORIENTATION FROM BEGIN TO DEATH
Bondage/Problems = Particles that we wish maybe too far away to do anything OR  ENERGY TO BRING THEM BACK  OR Convert them into original state is too high.

SPACE-TIME+AETHER MAGIC
Aether itself creates new particle no need for those retracting old particles and reforming them 
Souls can’t be created+ Souls will only get their body if they first exist in REGION OVER WHICH MAGIC WAS CASTED


If a soul( used to be earthian in 1780s) but now chilling on NEPTUNE  in present(2023) and earth’s time reverse to 1780 then on earth will be his hollow body but he will still be chilling on Neptune.
UNLESS AETHER MOVES HIS SOUL FROM NEPTUNE TO EARTH (ONLY AETHER CAN MOVE SOULS)

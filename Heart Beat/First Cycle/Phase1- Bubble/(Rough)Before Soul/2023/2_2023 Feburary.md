Day 12  
  

i was feeling GLOOMy type feeling fo over how i would never really be able to find human being who really understand me. No that is not the problem. The problem is that someday i will find a human that understand me BUT at very worng time, when it will be too late, i will be too bounded.  
How will i face, the people who i consider my own knowing they won't ever be able to see me.  
  
I was able to shove it and supress this desire to be understood and not have to conform and become like them so they can understand that new formed self, the one they wanted, the one they want to see.  
  
First i will become who i want to be and if after that still i feel this We will cry but before that no moaning and crying.  
  
I felt discouraged cause one of the things which i consider to be haoiness can also been seen as escaping form reality and BOOM the internal satisfaction disappers.

  
  
Day 15  
  

Today is monka's birthday and i have very bad seires of nightmare

I Decided not t to tolerate anymore disrespect and just sneak away like i wasn't there. However waht if the ysaw through and realise that i was just trying to hide my face that's whyi wnet away without saying Bye.  
TIME PASS AND IT WAS SAME DREAM, OR MAYBE IT'S COPNTINUATION OR A DIFFERENT DREAM.  
2) when i woke up, i was at place where my brother was sometime agoa and it was cave like shop or workshop he was inb which just collapsed deep in ground and it was all rambles, i knew it was from an terrorist attack,  
several car stopped slwoly slwoly as i was deciding on what to do, wheter ito climb down wait,  
my father then come out of huis car and tries to go down, i stop him, and say your body don't have strength to climb down that much low place, but a car hits my car and or\ur car hits me or my father and my father falls down, i tried to get him backup but continuous car maccident were happening everywehre due to chaos due to chaos.  
Actually cars were earlier at distance from the part where the edge of road end and it was hole(pit), but accidents pushed them more nera edge and ther e was very little space to just jump on other side after lifting him because our car was pushing us in valley and i just csomehow impossibly manage to get himup, jump on other side impossible jump in which a big xchunk of my body was still hanging but the part that wasn't hganging was enough on ground that i knew i can get myself up slowyl slwoly (My body was to heavy and slow and i was accepting it all like normal)  
we somehow got up but when i reached near road, car were coming one by pone and i was just avoiding accident byu breath distanstnce, i will just doge thought stabilzied myself, on e more car was coming my way, it happened 5-8x times before accident stopped and hte n i entered kind of an omnsicisent view and i understand situation as terrorist atttack and goverment silencing all witness and who knew reality (it was terrrorist attak) cause tjhey wanted to protect imag eof osme high level influential person.  
And i again accepoted a new thing normal unconsiously that my bro and all his class were earlier working on puzzle and fi someone solve that block puzzle current plight will be solved but last person who had that block didn't have last poiece to finish the puzzle.  
but then my brother, father , mother comes in,  
my brother's head was shaved and he was wearing an patient blue-green uniform on whom an surgery has been done. and he had finsihed puzzle but as i took it and handed it over it crumbled, But all others who were devoid of hope said to me okay okay and leave it to us we will complete it, you can go home,  
3) TIME PASS AND IT WAS SAME DREAM, OR MAYBE IT'S COPNTINUATION OR A DIFFERENT DREAM. It felt as if continuation of 1st dream.  
i was on road  
There was a boy who was bigshot of gang (roughly my age) SHOUTING RAGINGLY at everyone and looked like was looking for someone to beat. i felt that they were going to choose me out of group and beat me so before they choose me i submitted myself to him and asked to beat me but indirectly.  
It was instinctively  
I was pretending to be a meek, submissive fool so i cna get myself into higher opportunity situation.  
Agter few instnat , i recived few punches and before i knew tit there was circle of nearly 100 or more men (i don't know but to me they felt like lot), i was in middle getting beaten by their little boss, he after ounching me was laughing and berating me and enjoying.  
Instictively agian  
It felt perfect time to punch him in face (No logical thinking, it was just instictive what i was doing)  
Yet my body didn't punch with that much strength at all and it barbly managed to just give nough pain to anger him and don't make too shocked even tohugh i cahnged switches out of nowhere, and before i knew it i was grabbed by 100people. no wl ittle logical thinking kicked and it thought, even if he was low shoxck you should have run towards [erimeter fo circle push through people and run. why didn't you do that. why were you JUST CONFUSED AND HAYWIRED why youre punch didn't have strength.  
And MY INSTICTIVE INTELLIGENCE KIND OF CACCCEPTED AS THAT I AM JUST THAT WEAAK with little confusion styill in back of mindI was held in place and the view i was seeing in my mind was room, a nail in Center of my vision, then baam it will get nailed in wall, ground, everywhere in room at very high rate. WHenever there was baam noise i felt extrmee pain but of an hammer not of piercing BUT A BLUNT DAMAGE PAIN, and when nail hit wall, wall will fell off, grey colour duszt will collapse and the boy na d crowd were laughing.  
Wall was broken by nails yet i was still stnading  
It was all painful and overwhelming. But inutively intutively not logical but intutive that getting tortured by nails yb 100people should be more terrible right  
Howver pain kept increasing more and more and more  
i wanted to get away and that thought(it sohuld be more painful) was nowhere in my mind  
I wokeup from dream  
  
.  
  
And why does it sometime happens that a previous dream that i dreamt maybe fw days weeks months ago suddenly become an accpetable context in which new dream takes place  
  
  

  
  
Day 23  
  

My father said something that meant "iske jaisa bacha maa-baap ko bs preshan krwata hain"  
I knew hurt come maybe from MACRONI saying i like the one with nutreila  
I ONLY LEARNED IT LATER, EARLIER I WAS IN MERRY MOOD, thought io will relish the delicious meal after work.  
AND I WAS FEELING WHY was it like that.  
but it's dad own fault now i realise.  
mom made macroni without neutralaa for him, yet he didn't eat  
and now s angry with me saying that i like macroni with neutrila more.  
AND I NEVER EVEN SAID WITH HARSH TONE. I JUST SAID I LIKE MACRONI WITH NETRILA MORE> and havent i asked you earleir to bombard macroni wtih lot of neutrilla?  
  
I SEE I ACTUALLY JUST REALISED- Here i was supposed to have attitude of more like  
I am happy to eat macroni  
but i would have loved it more if neturilla was there, it just another realm of greatness to it.  
  
If it was piku i can be more like- "I am really happy you made XYZ for me" (It doesn't need to taste good, my happiness is in effort you put in)  
  
Maybe mom can be thanked more subtly in indirect ways -  
SMILE WHILE EAT, Kiss mom on cheek  
  
  
  
BUT THE REASON WHY I DIDN'T HAVE THAT ATTITUDE WAS- i was hurt from disappointment cause i was building expectation in my mind THAT HOW AM I GOING TO EAT IT LATER, so i was working hard.  
  
I was wondering what is wrong with me for not having left that much empathy or love-ish feeling? i mean my heart will really not care if my mom, dad, brother were to die.  
I will feel lonely for not having anyone surrounding me. But they as person don't matter, what m,atter is humans surrounding me.  
I just realised. i am not a bad person for thinking or feeling this way  
I don't feel acknowlege or seen.  
All i feel is them misundersatnding me & Their image o fme is very weak and poor.  
I hate it & it made me hate them in past, BUT ONE I SHOULD HATE IS THEIR INCOMPETENCE I GUESS? not them, they don't choose their karma  
I love how my mom atleast tries BUt i guess it's my faul.t or my karma fault that it's too heavy to entrust it to her.  
THNAKFULLY IT WON'T BE LONG.  
I will just have to be in place & become someone that isn't me & is more full of life and energy  
AND I CAN SHARE THAT ENERGETIC & LIVELY PERSON WITH OTHERS.  
I will have to fully drop my present behind SLWOLY SLWOLY make it rot  
I FEEL SAD THAT I HAVE TO BEAR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I really feel sad  
No what thing needs to rot is actually avery very very small part of me. veery very very small yet it controls me VER YVERY MUCH  
  
I see why father was angry was -he can;'t bend me like my mother or my brother.  
  
For the people we consider our own. We want their acknowledgement & acceptance.  
So that's why their words pains us.  
BUT DON'T GET BOGGED DOWN BY FEELING  
LOOK AT INTRICACY  
  
  
  
I Remeber kartikey and shubhankar called me NARCISSICT  
But i am not narcissict I AM PRIDEFUL  
BOTH ARE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT. I WASN'T SITTING ON TOP OF SOMETHING HOLLOW BUT REAL.  
  
I ALSO REALISED Why in JPM i felt i got pushed into weak position.  
IN GROUP IT'S POSSIBLE TO GAIN LOT OF POWER, EVEN IF ALL ARE STRANGERS.  
How, YOU ASK? Stand on an mountain, they wish to climb.  
STAND ATOP A SHARED GOAL!  
  
What if you have something only you can give? then maybe you will bne 1) godify or 2) gnawed at  
  
LAST WAY TO AVOID SUCH SITUATION IS () BE ONE (DEPTH FREINDSHIP) WITH MOST INFLUENTIAL INDIVIDUAL OF GROUP  
If your level of friendship with someone exceeds from all group. THAT SOMEONE WILL BE TOO HESITANT TO PULL OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  
  
  
NOTHING GOES TO WASTE.  
Seeing it is a waste, is value-judgement based on UTILITY.  
SUPPOSE because of your suffering you have to went through, you suddenly get summoned to an iskeai and all your dreams & desires gets fulfilled willl you still see those 4 years as WASTE?  
Would you think that it'd be better, if the purer you i.e. Agrim who didn't went through those should be sent OR WILL YOU APPRECIATE ALL THE JOYS MORE.  
Cuz this weight will just wilt and fall, when you meaningfully interact and you have exoerienced it.  
SO THIS ONLY ADD REACHNESS & YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO FEEL HAPPY OVERT SMALLEST THINGS & BE glad that  
Even if forward journey is painful.  
Wherever i am is higher than the hell i have seen.  
AND I AM IN A PLACE ONE TIME I COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINE.  
I SAW THINGS, THE HOPE, I NEVER IMAGINED  
I ONLY HAVE THINGS THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED TO LOOK FORWARD TOO.  
How can you call it timewaste, how can you say you WANT TO RIP IT AWAY.  
THAT SAYING IS BASED ON VALUE-JUDEMENT OR UTILITY-JUDGEMENT  
You can say that you have absorbed lot of -ve traits, habits BUT +VE LEARNED FAR OUTWEIGH -ve FROM UTILITY POINT.  
The reason why you can't or maybe feel difficulty in seeing it's emotional benifits to your life-satisafaction and happiness IS BECAUSE YOU ARE in wrong state, living wrong life, why should that be rewarded, why will it be rewarded by happiness, when you yourself deem it -ve?  
  
INSTEAD OF RIPPING IT AWAY SAY  
I have lived wrong life for far too long. I WANT TO LIVE AN LIFE WHERE I WILLN'T FEEL TO HIDE DUE TO SHAME  
  
  
What made that day special was my emotion getting acknowledge, and me beliving seh can somehow read my mind cause something like this felt like magic, SINCE NEVER HAVE IT ONCE HAPPENED WHERE SOMEONE CRIED FOR MY PAIN  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
Day 25  
  

I almost convinved myself to slep today and we will start from tom,morow, but i was able to step outside the box i just created and i set a timer atter 30 min for 10 hig difficulty maths question to open so my sleep will open, howeve ri got recharge after short nap, i had a little drream 2-3 dreams. i only remeber vague 1) i was running in a place from someone who i had met actually few time before but tin dreams, it's something which is in active m memory of dream agrim but not in real world agrim, i was partially aware, i sped too fast unfortunately that dream broke, after that i was in batman tyope dream where i g0o torrecuse someone but he got blast up in car, and then batman's expensive car and other expensive car with weapons on, look at us and i die, in next ithere was tab open of po**, my mom came i was tryin to lcose them while mom trying to lift it. i woke up

  
  
Day 26  
  

What was it that was driving me and making feel horrible for not liking thinking of college and college memories and stuff CUZ feel of not belonging.  
I guess its a deep happiness and meaning center whose lack will make you feel horrible.  
I ALSO NOW UNDERSTAND why i felt kind of hesistant to join coaching now in late months, cause aside from all -veshit, in the end i will feel i dont belong in this structure, they lack experiences & tools to understand me, in childhood maybe i saw Kota as a place where i will belong, i will find more people like me and wfeel happy, which i surely surely would have BUT Ugh!,  
I GUESS I UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEKIND OF EMOTION BLUNTING DRUG MAY HELP ME, cuz since i cant cut myself and remove some part of me, no matter how much desperation i feel.  
Nor there is any drug that just can remove this dependency from my brain on other humans for meaning.  
BUT  
  
WHAT IS SENSE OF BELONGING?  
1) it's an biological thing. The reason why i loved class5th was for the very very first time in life, i felt acknowledge and sense of belonging that was what made me feel great and in 8th class too it was that. HOWEVER IN 9th class you lacked it so it felt horrible.,  
The reason why that day in JPM felt so nice. I felt acknowledged and welcomed by others, everyone being nice, ACTUALY ACTUALLY warmness or niceness can easily compensate from similiar interest since interest are kind of flickering just grounded in human experience warmth is enough  
2) And in terms of similar interest & relating,  
Yes you may not care for boards, cse, iit, college, etx  
YOU CAN RELATE TO LOT OF DEPRESSEED PEOPLE AND TALK T OT THEM FOR HOURS AND FEEL FULFILLED. Just how good that compliment felt just knowing it came from someone who had gone through similar experience? Dont you see?  
In that past a lot of people may have to go through that horrible experience their whole life full of potential, which was supposedly maybe going happy turn into hell AND HTEM NEVER ESCAPING IT AND IT ONLY WORSENING WITH TIME. Each minute of it is so painful, now if you make hour out of minute and days of hours and years of days. JUST JSUT JUST HOW HOW HOW MUCH HORRIBLE they would have felt any of their attempts were never seen or acknowledging it  
3) I want a world of my own, a place where i will say i belong to, is me, i.e. my fictional world where i will amalgamate all of those things important to me and pour it out.

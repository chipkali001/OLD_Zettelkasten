Create OWN Truth you need to believe IN to get what you want

NEVER create Distance between future & present. Make it about process or it wont be sustainable & you everthing will collapse on itself.

4s commit sin of associating with their emotion WE ASCRIBE MEANING TO THE EMOTIONS. Feeling pain, sad, bored, lonely, etc NEEDEN’T EQUATE TO BAD. you can make meaning out of

**YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO DVD GGNS atleast 5-10min day. ITS MUST**

Write Views, Opinions, Criticism, likes, dislikes FOR **MOVIES** & **WEBSERIES** & **NOVELS** you read.

**Give YOURSELF FUN WITH SELF. Little things in life** - MEDITATE 3 MIN ON OUTSIDE. Enjoy it. Look forward to it.

INFJs need to focus on the pleasure of process instead of outcomes, then a lot of this is resolved. For Ni heroes obstacle is the way.

Eating food everyday isnt expedient

Listen to SV voie, actions, lips ATLEAST 1x DAY to get energy FOR FUTURE

No idea is original, DONT CARE about citations much.

You dont need to share **THE TRUMP CARD** so you an stay at top

INXJ your time & attention is most valuable YOU MAY SPEND whole life trying to figure out - towards who yto give your time and effort, your Si demon is the greatest treasure.
DO TEST OF DEMON you SHOULD expect a tribute DONT ALLOW yourself to be used.
If you are giving them time & attention, you SHOULD expect a tribute. 
Are people honoring your time & attention, then DOORSLAM
Ni(Hero)+Si(Demon) energy deserves to be respected.
INJs feels "I dont share myself with anyone, why are you sharing yourself with just everyone, dont you have anything that is sacred to you?"
They want to be treated as someone sacred.

Dont divide world - this is shallow - this is meanigful: RELISH EVERY BREAtH, everything has meaning dont cut, you are only cutting yourself by doing so

**ESTP** THE  *PERSUADER* wants to persuade people.  It’s  when you combine with COMPETENCE of **INFJ**
Going Aspirationally activates ESTP. BECOMING SOMETHING MORE
SUPER EGO - ISTJ are SUPER-ORGANISE

ESTP langauge - **Dentist & phycologist are kind of same thing bot h wear white coat.** No they arent same **well if both were standing you wont be able to tell difference, would you.**

If you cant bring yourself to enjoy social situation, you can amp up your energy by thinking that these humans are going to ide, you dont know path they will have to thread upon & amount of suffering they will have to face.

Since they have always treated you like an ORBO that they won & instruct YOU SHOULD OO SEE ALL OF HEM as robots just bounded by their programming

Si (Demon) abandoned feeling trigger, extreme selfishness, MY EXPERIENCE. Demon will fight for inferior if noone else will. If inferior function is abandoned by everyone. It doesnt feel fabric of reality welomes it then Demon function will grow. Si(Demon) will give Se - THE POWER, CONTROL it has always wanted.
The VERY VERY reason i dont felt bad for BOARDS or IIT Falling was I have experiened worser hell. So dark that it cant be understood by any normal people. 
Maybe I can use Si to reach the highest IDEAL

INFJ shouldnt are about performane - as long as they gain more data, tehy can beome msost useful person but for that they will have to allow themselves to ahve bad performane or mediore performance sometimes, so they can latercan gain more experine to evolve.
INFJ & INTJ gains best FROM PRACTICE not all types does

Your lust is ACORDING TO BODY’S CYCLE. One moment you will be dog & in other you’ll not even care, wheter your groin exist or not.

It’s not only you to whom things are unfair, it’s to so so so many people & you just assuming it’s only you is height of selfishness.
Didn’t you gain something back to. you arent descending down and down. you have too much ohpe & potential for going up not everyone is this blessed

**





Enhoy social situations more by sayinh

PUt yourself in RISKY dangerous, painful, awkward & UNUSUAL situations so you can have more stories










Pursue meaning, if happiness comes its great if not then too it’s okay



SUYASH even thinks he an berate you - 
Who is the shut in DON’T KNOW LIFE?
Who is intelligent one if cant pass exam
BECOME YOUR ESTP subconsious


I SEE MY CHILDHOOD WITH PITY.
SO WEAK, SO EASILY, PUSHED AROUND.
ENSLAVED IN ILLUSIONS THAT WILL ATTACK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DEFEND YOURSELF WITH

1.  Party bhiya & ayush side ENVY. WHY AM I EXCLUDED?
    

2.  Rudra incident where COC was stolen,  no one stood with me, ayush took rudra side,
    

3.  Mom & dad turned on me instead of trying to understand just imposing  I refused to sleep, then when 1-2hr passed my patience burst i went to mom and cried and they but denied, called it my madness more. Downloaded COC after doing so many jugaad, but i for some reason did it openly so i could show rebellion but it too was pushed down. 
    

4.  I daily think coc before sleeping but that reason was stolen from me. I tried to fight for myself but I was pushed down.
    

5.  I finally got one connecting link to ayush and was so happy but it was stolen More and more my classmates began to play.
    

6.  Sister of CJC making fun of totla pan, i tried not ot be weak but it stuck with me. I DIDN’T GIVE IN MY HEAD.
    

7.  Devrath made fun of my totla pan, it was painful and didt felt good.
    

8.  Me trying to speak hindi synonym to makeup and hide
    

9.  I stopped eating lunch in school because it felt pathetic to be the only one sitting and eating alone. I used to eat lunch in the car once school finished after 2pm.
    

10.  In childhood you tried to compete and win with Ayush cuz you were jealous of how Ayush got treated specially because he was smart and used to come top.  YOU WANTED THE SAME.
    

YOU WANTED TO BE BETTER THAN HIM MOSTLY DUE TO THAT THING. YOU WANTED TO BE LIKE AYUSH.

11.  Ayush in stanford too, you felt cheated, how he easily becomes popular with all since he is managing sports, and still get good marks, you too work hard yet not rewarded in that manner
    

12.  You hated how rudra can JUST USE CORRUPTION POWER to gain importance. Since monica mam was respected and loved he leached and enjoyed the fruits of that. YOU WERE ANGRY, JEALOUS, FELT CHEATED BY SYSTEM
    

13.  Rudra and Monica Mam blamed you falsely, NO ONE Stood for you, everyone turned their backs. Mom, Dad just used it as an excuse to justify what they wish to do.  SHOULDN’T FIRST ACTION OF YOUR PARENTS SHOULD BE TO STAND WITH YOU? BUT WHAT HAPPENED?
    

They care for your physical body and their expectations of you.

BUT NO ONE CARES WHAT YOUR DREAMS, ASPIRATIONS ARE, WHAT GIVES YOU INTERNAL FULFILMENT. THEY don’t care

AND INSTEAD THEY MADE YOU FEEL SHAME.

THAT I SULLIED THEIR NAME

Even though all my life till class 9th i have been so much clingy and dependent on my mom & dad having a good image of me. BEING A GOOD BOY FOR THEM.

I caged myself so much for them.

I wanted to make them proud.

AS I WAS NOT FEELING SHAMEFUL AS IT IS.

AND AND

SHOULDN’T YOUR FRIENDS STAND WITH YOU?

But what did ayush said. It’s a good thing that happened it’s your fault, i am with rudra.

I FELT SO ALONE. NOONE CAME TO CARE FOR ME AND SAY I AM BY YOUR SIDE NOT EVEN ONE PERSON

  

YOU WERE forced and shutdown.

You rebelled and were again shutdown

  

LEARN YOUR LESSON. 

HOW CORRUPT HUMAN IS

MOM & DAD JUST HAVING “MORE POWER” = MISUSE FOR EGO SATISFACTION

Misuse even on the closest and the dearest

AYUSH, No VALUE for thing you ALWAYS HAVE

  

14.  Ayush not giving much mind or importance to my message and you feeling betrayed and cheated
    

15.  Father & Mother shutting off my games, according to his whims (no pubg, this that)
    

16.  Not allowing to watch stuff everyone else watches, by saying that yee ldkiya dekhti, felt left out when others talked about something with passion
    

17.  Khelo even though you don’t enjoy it don’t talk, cuz ldkiya baat karti hai, 
    

18.  I was sleeping only 5 hours, it took time and effort to adjust, the only break i will take was while eating (i will watch anime episode), and my father & mother would scold me don’t waste time in that. Agar 30min khane me nikal doge to din bhar 2 ghanta isme hi barbaad hogya. Isme sleep or do something else. 
    

19.  While eating dinner and watching anime, my father came and took my phone away.=
    

20.  Drowning in cjc trip, thinking of mom dad sad gave me strength but my flaliling didn't helped. I tried to go back to pool but my body refused from faraway, in kids pool where there was only me of my age and noone else, i tried to walk down powl staircase and moment my feet touched water i just pulled back, i then sat on corner and flail my legs while my body shivering from time to time. So that someone who sees me will feel like me having fun, and i was just observing everything
    

21.  Rudra and other kids swarming around there, rudra exacting his jealousy on me and I didn't fight or defend.
    

22.  In stanford during sports i will feel left out 
    

23.  Always a problem with group friendships, only individuals liked. I felt left out from groups a lot of the time. Example- ayush-saransh bhiya, ayush-kunal, ayush-others, etc.
    

Something they all have but I am missing.

24.  In GRM it was shitty shitty. I DON’T WANT TO BE LIKE THEM. MY BIOLOGY DENIES THAT LIFE. 
    

My biology denied the easy life of school, naturally finding someone you love and having cute time together.

NO! NO! There is no value of a special person if I don't struggle, VALUE of TRUE COMPANY would only be experienced if i had faced CRIPPLING LONELINESS.

THIS ALL IS BUILD UP. Build up for special, THE BEST.

I willn’t waste all this BuildUp on some LOW QUALITY CHEAP MEAL

25.  Devrath swiftly talking 
    
26.  In 9th, you used to wake up so early to study without alarm or anyone and no matter how you feel you will study with unstoppable dedication, it's not your fault. Structures weren't guiding you and the structure you got unacademy was flawed, maths and chemistry teacher both sucked and they dragged your physics down and everything went down with them.
    
27.  I REMEMBER AS A CHILD, I WASN'T JUST SHY. SHYNESS COMES FROM LACK OF COURAGE. I WAS LiTtLE COWARDLY BUT I THINK LOT OF IT WAS SHAME.
    

I wish so badly that i wasn't born in this body. I wanted a different physical body and i wished that i was either born to different normal parents or i was orphan but just not here not in this position.  A lot of things doing were supposed to have given me confidence but they never did, why?

Cause problem was shame? I was ashamed?  And outerworldly things willnt cover the shame.

I felt shame even for my name cuz i felt that they assumed with my name that i am muslim and it reflected in thier behaviour, they way they make fun of me and 

I though oh god no! Even my name has something wrong in it.

Why can't i be just normal human being? 

I am happy if i can just be normal human being. I don't want anything too high or too low just normal.

And problem was i knew it somehowere in my mind that it's just misunderstanding so it can be resolved slowly

And it seemed such silly reason to go to maybe my friend and complaint to them maybe get little angry.

But i slwoly with time, i start to develop hate for my name.

I think because it's something i have told myself since childhood so my voice cracks when i say i hate my name ? Because i have proggramed myself to hate my name?

  
  

 and i am again put in weird position and i don't know how am I supposed to play from here

**28.    The reason why i integrated hindi synonyms and words in my natural way of speaking was to not get laughed and them using at as an joke to laugh at.**

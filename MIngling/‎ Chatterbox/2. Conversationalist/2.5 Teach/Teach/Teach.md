FIrst teach basic MBTI & *4 minds theory*- we also tend to project one of these minds on other humans(Fathers living through child. You dont love the real me, just a part) - then directly move to *communication style* teahing soemthing tangible they can see in real-life & use it & feel like OH THIS THEROY IS SOI ADVANCED. like cognitive transation may lead you to believe on incident that person is Direct/Indirect.
ALSO SPEW SOME INTERSTING FACTS- like NOTHING like AMBIVERT exist.& Introversion is max 2 people. extraversion is >2people. I willnt say to you 

Begin With - Based on cognitive functions - What are cognitive functions you can call them 8 lenses through which reality can be seen & we use combination of those lenses, giving priority and power to certain lenses TO POINT OF ABUSE & disregrading , ignoring certain.
YOu may have felt something/some-vbehaviour, wasy of seeing thinking look so natural/ normal to you but someone-else is ocmpletly blind to your reality
IN PODCAST, CIA ex-person told that he used to use MBTI. to understand nature. 

Ask - which function you will like me to begin with?
Which should I talk?
Choose between? 


I have watched Korea have mbti hype.
They don't even know what they are talking about.
Sensors not allowed
Feelers not allowed
Perfeivers not alloed
Where companies don't allow particular MBTI types.
You can think like i 

Cognitive function are what you use to make judgement and perception about world.
**this is just model to contain few facets**
Think of yourself as computer and you have 8 programs running. Each program is allocated certain amount of power, unequal one will have most. Other will have leastm
Differences/its-so-simple arise.



Dohave u read about personality theories?
1. Enneagram:- energies, about heart, energy, sin you commit
2. Big Five+ Dark-Triad:- Adjectives to give precision they took 10k+ adrctives and try to 5 traits that they considered the root 
3. Not one but multiple theories by different people combined but they revolve around cognitive function. It's the best, most nuanced and complicated but that makes it better. (Analogy/schema cuz it's complicated and willnt stick if I don't do this- let's say **we** create a personality system for animals using senses (let's take only 4 sense). Personality type1 is fzn in one order specific.   The one who uses  smell the most let's call that smell dominat or smell hero and now as we were doing research about senses rank system we may see the animals who have eyes first always have smell last.(it's not like they can't smell but they have such beautiful eyes they don't rely on their nose) Or eyes first means they had taste/touch second/third
4. Fe feeds on reactions of Fi
5. I have heard you can Learn about person more than you'll learn in 10 years
6. Example f FeTi vs FiTe from manga. Character was laughing how his wife told him to quit smoking so what he did say. Yes I want to be good dad & example to my kids

****

See now fiction isn't reality but but themes and archetypes are related. 

Please fight me when you have atleast listen to full thing I want to say what I am trying to tell you isn't a small detail you can pick then start screaming about it. It's complex intertwined thing.
**it's like how should I put
You try to explain to me how respiration system works so you draw diagram and you are in just process of diagram you haven't even drawn the full diagram.
And i start to say, no lungs aren't like that you had this type of til here, this thickness is like this, here this , here that.
Do you think I have become very smart by asking questions like that to you. You haven't even drawn diagram and i have never even heard of word respiration**

Why should I listen to mbti stuff.
To widen perception since we only take only small portion it. 
We only mesh with certain types.
Well things is u must have felt that as when you aged your perception widen. Things you didn't deemed important before became important overtime. That is your perception widening. So this act as hole.
Father of one who created it was ________ __ _ __ and he did _ __ _.

Si honour, tradition, suffering stand, comfort, long term memory

To fighting types that question everything and fight. 
Instead of acting as person who has mastered mbti.
Act like i havhave been **exploring** this *personality type stuff* and it is...


Udja.app
Try to do with in mind that actually even though inthere questions u will be asked is dew theroy patterns and everything is really deep and complex.
And we actually don't have 1 but 4 personality type inside of us
1 main ego = your type
2 subconscious personality= aspiring and pursuit brings joy happinesss
3 shadow (unconscious) personality= source of your maturity wisdom and also all the negative traits of your personality visible or invisible to you
4 superego - it's not important for now 
*Now in giving test human tendency is to choose option that your shadow personality or subconscious personality will choose*
So you really have to see suppose if I rip out all the memories and learnings and wisdom and maturity and family etc all you have 
And now you are not "xyz(input name)" but a wild "xyz(input name)" and you are observing wild xyz from outside how will he play and act.
Also also try to use ur childhood more cuz in childhood you are more purely in your ego but as you grow your other 4 personality also develops so it pollutes things and makes things difficult.
Also also just last note that you are complicated special person so test may not give accurate result for you, you may have to yourself perhaps do your research on theroy to come to an enclosure about your type.


Types doesn't restrict you like you are talking.
It's more like are you human?
Can I put label of human on you?
Having label human doesn't undermine your individuality actually human is wide enough that it covers and considers your individuality.
So look at it from that point.
And reason why you don't consider it limiting cause you know its not limiting. You know little about biology right?
And your question to me - it is putting you in box. Is tribal person learning biology for first time. And when you talk to them type of creatures - someone says i am not human - me bhagwan ka farista hun




And even if you say no i am beyond being human mein bhagwan ka farishta hun.
You like human food, humans medicine works for you, you do stuff humans do, you being label human has some utility right and you still have your individuality.

It has biological and nurture component both.

Personality type is fixed.
But think of it this way you can say to me that once you use to be so weak you'll get tired from walking and now you have big muscles you can fight gang alone, lift 100kg, you aren't human anymore.
No! Those things doesn't take your humanity from you. You can become strong grow mature.
Maybe starvation will turn same person into something.
Posion into something.
Different diet, etc.


Si in this modern world neccesairly not need to follow traditions however they have internal dialogue on seeing things like
That shape of bottle xyz had it or a memory
They are undergoing subjective dialogue when they interact.
Se this is bottle how ma i supposed to use this
Se-Ni linked

**Show first diagram on phone to better explain**
Types based on cognitive function and what are cognitive function first let me give you analogy it's an interconnected broad thing.
You can say let's say each of your senses is a congitive fucntion.
Now these hierarchy the order in which your preference of use of senses are written is your personality type.
Give example of order
It doesn't change. And it's broad enough you'll not feel restricted like if i say you are human you are not being restricted. 
1) there are 8 cognitive function 4-percwption 4-judgment
2) there are 16 personality types now you can think i said 8 cognitive function and their arrangment can be but actually all function are in a specific order and arrangment you just need to know one perception cognitive function and one inituibe cognitive tion and it's position in stack to figure out a perosns MBTI type
3) 4-sides of mind theory- we have 4 of them in our ego, main personality. And rest 4 in shadow. However here too if you know one personality type of their mind you can tell what is shadow anima superego. And these perosnlaity are clusters 
4) there are only 4 types of mind and think of it as Rubik's cube myhead- ego, mybody- shadow, my fwd gaze subconscious, my kicks superego and that Rubik's cub. 
5) let me explain ego shadow stuff. We actually have 4 perosnlity types in our brain: ego superego,  shadow, anima(subconscious)
6)  we normally live in ego but if person lives in abusive household where they receted his ego, then perosn maybe stick entire time in shadow, which happen cause MBTI of others too. We have tendency to evaluate gauge compare perosn on basis of shadow or subconscious type. 
7) MBTI tool to know 1st two cognitive functions and rest as i told you can figure out if you know two 



Margret tyrell fe hero **enfj** how she is so wifggly shifting according to situation and controlling and taking lead subtly. 
Or has to be Super highly evolved special version of enfp. (Enfp have stronger rigidity for values and standing for it they don't bend as much and if they will only little)
Mother didn't like her manipulating and controlling joffery. 
She never even had fight with Joffrey whearas sansa stark who is more Si/Fi or Si/Fe (duty base) person does




Pure logic practice - permutation and combination 
Pattern detection practice - trigonometry ph1
Mixed - straight-line + circle


PEOPLE HAVE THEIR NURTURE component but A LOT IS NATURE  & THEORY complex enough that it encompasses a lot.

**DONT TELL PEOPLE THEIR MBTI TYPE. THAT’S RUDE. Slowly build interest covertly**

Not ride off people as stupid.
Understand, manipulate, understand blind spot, worry, etc.
YOU CAN GAIN UNDERSTANDING THAT WILL OTHERWISE TAKE 10YEARS

Which cognitive function involved. which temperament will say that? 
I am proud to be Indian. I will die for my country - SJs /Si+ Fi
Jatt hai hum - Fi
I hate snakes who betray their own family - Fi

Difference between Ti & Te
Ti has power to go more depth but less spread. MORE DEPTH
Te has less less depth but more spread. MORE SPREAD - others method
Now more depth necearily means smart.
I DONT HAVE GOOD EXAMPLE ON THE SPOT.
Lets say story. A man lives on shore, sees pattern in star GODDESS Y, that when that star which is GODX is twinkling it rains, if that is there this happens. NOW Ti has find a drilling site.
Ti user may go and bring some food or do ritual to see if gods like it and make it rain. IT DOESN’T RAIN.
Ti user may then recall that GOD X actually drink/eat this not that & he will d oother thing to satiate him & kind of Ti is going deeper BUT HE IS STUPID. He an become very mentally rigid.

**FIRST BUILD ACCURACY --→ THEN PRECISION
ACCURACY BUILD =**
1. For each MBTI create stories, CHARACTER SKETCH- Face, hair, clothes, ACCESORY how face you will imagine will look. EXAGGERATE QUALITIES & TRAITS. & STORIES
2. Show YT interview OF PBD - Draw 4-5 charts in front of eyes so they can live use it - he is strong personality so easy to BUILD ACCURACY
PRECISION = Suggest Books, Videos, My Notes more

Te Si Ne Fi Ti Se Ni Fe
Gym really seriously, fit body, make sure people/group compliant
Extremely organized.
Rational, all about routine, self-discipline.
Responsible with Si- take many experience as long it’s the BEST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE they would get.
All about what other want, no clue of what they want (TRICKSTER)
Why do you want that
I dont feel like (Fi) you should think that (Te) because that will give you bad future (Ne) which will give me bad experience (Si) because i have to deal with you are stupid (Te)
SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN LEAP INTO ANOTHER 4-BRAIN MODES TO (DEPEND ON MATURITY, INTEGRATION)
Innocently want to give what you want, Child Ne wants to give others candy.
ISTJ - i’ll just create & test process.
Prefer to be bottom, They can give into giving Se critic but get tired quickly.
Fi = insecure about how they & other feel = they go around life feeling bad person.

Way to win them
I think {(Te)=engages their hero} you have such giving heart (Fi=insecure) because of X, Y, Z (Te=give them X, Y, Z for them to chew on). Tell them you think good of them.

They put on tough front but they have mushy heart.
ESTJ=ego=shallow due to Se critic=elitist=if they shoe not tied, they loose all respect for you=hold themselve to impossibly high standard=thats why go to gym, can bear fat =all about 1st impressopn

Ego shallow but once they go beyond. Once they get over inscecurity 4thSe can access deeper INFP (Anima). & become super deep & amazing at one-one deep & eventually becomes more NF (idealist)

You should be able to do it,  you would want to do it because i too felt bad in past.

Ti Nemisis worry if they are not smart/correct/right - they need external humans opinon to get over it.

They want to give other ideal party (Se)
Cirticise other for looking bad.
Te - all about staus/okay as everyone think they are right/cool./as long as people believe it it’s fine. ESTJ dont use it maliciously but NFPs really play with it.

Straight up tell them what you want.

They can be convinved to do anything cuz Ni-trickster=not aware of best path/future.

They complain they live life backwards, they had all fun in youth. (But if INFP developed they do it)

DEMON Fe- dont care about giving other experience
ESTJ dont care about your problem, they are too bothered by their problem UNTIL INFP

Group of Fe wont work well, they want to give each other experience & no Fi to recieve it, but if their is -ve Fi then entire room will feel bad.
Now if group make -ve positive, then whole group will become +ve.

They make fun of you at every opportunity On Se, appearance, etc.

When ENFJ super-ego activate, they are CRULEST PEOPLE ON planet, they will shove down your throat every bad experience you gave them. YOU WOULD WANT TO RUN AWAY FROM THEM BADLY. why shall i trust you/ you ar bad person. her’s list of bad things you have done to me. 

Si is loyal, dont do loyalty check & bad experience = Se critic dont appreciate that. (Si in genral too dont like it)

Say what they mean, mean what they say.

I loved zombie movies and horror movie. 
I remember a time where I would watch every zombie movie i can get my hand on .
Ab to bhot saalo see webseries hi dekh rha hun to wo chiz chuut gyi
**Collapse of order is dreamy** 

**Interstellar** was really amazing, it made feel emotional, dad was her ghost, it was so nice.

**The Matrix**- nice. I wasn’t impressed or felt emotional but okey-dokey. Romance in 1st movie felt too fast _not impressed_
In Movie2 everyone was horny
Didn’t like the part where Neo kisses the wife of that person, so he can get access to the keymaker, it felt like the author is writing his porn fantasies. It was out of place

**DaVinchiCode** - I don’t know the historical reference, i want to watch it once i have learned more history and religion so i can enjoy it more.

**JohnWick** - I don’t like stories that revolve around action and nothing more.

**GodFather** - I gut Tired and bit confused

**Batman** - i rember one time i watched it with saransh bhiya in dark room, it had me feeling like crying.
It was okay i guess?
FIRST MOVIE WAS MY FAVIOURITE BECAUSE OF HIS DISALOGUES
“i'm not a monster i'm just ahead of the curve”
“I Believe That Whatever Doesn’t Kill You, Simply Makes You... Stranger!”
"And I Thought MY Jokes Were Bad!"
"I'm A Dog Chasing Cars. I Wouldn't Know What To Do With One If I Caught It!"
"It's Not About Money. It's About Sending A Message. Everything Burns!"
“This Town Deserves A Better Class Of Criminal, And I’m Gonna Give It to ‘Em!”
“This Is What Happens When An Unstoppable Force Meets An Immovable Object.”
“Madness, As You Know, Is Like Gravity. All It Takes Is A Little Push!”
“Introduce A Little Anarchy, Upset The Established Order, And Everything Becomes Chaos!”
“Why So Serious?”
"Ah you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!"



# Pursuit of Happiness
I WILL READ NOVEL, movie i dropped it after 25-30min. It felt like parody and was just trying too hard to be INFORMATIVE? IT FELT EDGY.
This part of my life is __
Everything was made to done so smoothly that it didnt even felt real
There was zero subtly depth, it was made for dumb people who will just invest their emotion in anything and cant have capability to discern.
And all just felt kind of being done to make it feel dramatic, his wife character didn’t even felt real NOR any of their emotions.
Maybe novel will be less morphed for sake of creating drama i guess?
I CANT INVEST MY EMOTIONS IN CHARACTER that feel like PARODY
WATCHING MOVIE WAS PAINFUL MY MIND WAS JUST PICKING OUT THINGS FOR INTUTION TO GOBBLE ON IT.
If it’s real incident i will either see real life things narrated and not morpherd, or if morphed let the one who suffered morph it.
If it’s a movie, it has to be great and have that subtly, depth and eloquance of sad movie.


Eh~

**IMOVIE FELT LIKE PARODY, NOT EVEN FOR SINGLE MOMENT I BELIEVE that i am actually seeing real humans interact, IT FELT PARODY. There was no subtly.**

**I CANT EVEN UNDERSTAND “Why people SAY IT KIND OF LIFE CHANGING & PROFOUND**

There was no HUMAN CONNECTION BETWEEN man and wife NOT EVEN HUMAN

FIrst thing, i hated the wife character

The way MC was explaining story and reply was just brushing IT aside everyday you have a new story.

THE whole movie felt kind of cartoonish as it was trying to be PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS

**IT TRIED TOO HARD JSUT TO SATISFY TROPE THAT A MAN IS STRUGGLING HARD, his wife left him and Hoo Now man is sad.**

When women said to man “I am just not happy” FELT TOO SHALLOW. REALLY TOO SHALLOW.

It was never shown WHY? She doesn’t seems to even be struggling or trying?

Does she have some desire which lack of money is hampering with and she can’t be happy?

LIKE I TOLD IT’S CARTOONISH AND JUST TRYING TO HARD.

She let’s say just don’t like pressure of the rent piling up and she can escape all that by leaving him.

AND WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE IF YOU YOURSELF ARE HAPPY OR SAD. IF PERSON YOU CARE ABOUT IS STRUGGLING AND TRYING BEST TO SOLVE PROBLEM THAT CONCErN WHOLE OF FAMILY (EVEN YOU).

IT WILL MAKE SENSE IF THAT PERSON HAVE BECOME STAGNANT AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS.

But i don’t think i will care about i am happy or my mood is bad, irritated IF a person i care about is in such place or MAYBE I JUST DON’T CARE AT ALL.

She seesm to balming IT ALL ON Main Character and herself JUST NOT DOING ANYTHING.

Atleast show some side interest she FEEL is better than here.

THERE IS A LIFE SHE WANTS AND SHE ISN’T GETTING IT. Her desire were never shown.

HER LIFE WAS NEVER SHOWN HAMPERED BY FINANCIAL ISSUE.

**IT WAS JUST A DUMB MOVIE**

**Man too WAS DUMB**

Why is she doing this? what dependency she even have THAT MAKES NOIT HAVING MONEY SAD . ALL WE hear is RENT. Okay ui understand they have pressure. BUT THAT'S IT? She doesnt seem interested at all in his endevaors to get out of debt? AND HER LIFE ISN'T EVEN SHOWN IMPARED IN ANY WAY that becuase they dont have money the (1) She cant have sp,ething she wants (2) she cant give her child something she want for kid (3) Something she likes/love is being denied of . AND IN THE END SHE ESCAPE THE PRESSURE BY QUITTING. That's it and says she is not happy? (4) She wasnt even shown working hard for her family? SHE WASNT EVEN DOING SOME REAL WORK IF IT BOTHERED HER THAT MUCH a human will do something

ALL HIS EFFORTS ARE DISMISSIED nor WIFE SEEMS TO BE PUSHING HERSELF

He was grown without knowing his father so he wanted his kids to know their father.

BUT WHY EXACTLY DID HE CARE ABOUT MISSING FATHER, WHAT WAS SITUATION THAT MADE HIM feel why did he not have father and a lot of others kdis who have father have _____. THERE WASN’T ANY WAVES THAT RIPPLE OUT FORM THAT BEING CASE.

2.  Why didn’t he take multiple JOBS? Why only one job? Are other jobs not available? SHOW IT! SAME REASON IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE FOR WIFE TO BE ANGRY AT HIM FOR STOCKBROKER, Cuz let’s say he was doing multiple job and he say he want to leave one of the jobs to do STOCKBROKING STUFF. WIFE CAN GET ANGRY.

Wife wants more time, AND SHE WILLN’T GET IT. MAKE SENSE,

**First thing, THE FIRST job isn't working, Even if it's working He isn't dropping it, HE SAID HE WILL DO IT IN LATER TIMES AND ADJUST IT.**

**OR IF SHE IS JUST FRUSTATED, AND she pointing these things out to FEEL GOOD and relieve herself. DIDN’T FELT LIKE THAT**

**IT WASN’T JUST BELIEVABLE AT ALL**

ANIME Atleast start on premise OBVIOUSLY THIS ALL IS NOT REAL AND since it;' snot real BUT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER SCENE THAT FEELS HUMAN-LIKE. You are like Aaah

**If story was him survivng toxic relationship with his wife then i would have like the show.**

**THERE WASN'T ANY SUBTLTY I can't understand why people make it so profound a man struggling and learning.**

Pursuit of happiness IT’S NAME ITSELF is UNFIT! Story wasant about pursuit of happinerss you cant pursue happiness, suppose i stab you and you are bleeding on ground or doctors are operating on you and what do you think you say to them “I am not happy” “I want to pursue happiness”

AND TGAT’S NOT THE POINT

If one of your family member is there BLEEDING

Will you say I want happiness? WHEN ALL YOU WERE DOING IS JUST WACCHING AND COMPLAINING?

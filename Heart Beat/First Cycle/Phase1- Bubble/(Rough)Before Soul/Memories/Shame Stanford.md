In front of me was the mam that was most strict and chuglikhor type. I was scared wheter she will complain to my mom.

See in 5th-7th class all my teachers used to say that i am so sincere, Shareef, sanskari baacha hai, they were hardly any complains about me so i had an immense pressure on me to be a sanskari balak.Â 

I WASN'T WEAK. I WAS NEVER EVER WEAK.

But they continue apply forces to make me weak.

In 5th class i wanted to participate, i was never ever against it.

In dance period i went away due to other reason and other time there were other reason. YET THEY BOTH SUPERIMPOSED introvert.

Mam said in front of kids you're introvert, shy you odn't participate.

Made a scene

I MAYBE LITTLE SENSTIVE AND HIGHTENED FEAR BUT IN NO WAY I WAS COWARD. I HAD LOT OF BRAVIETY. they don't see the things i see.

But when they make a scene out of it and impose an identity on me, i felt it, i saw it clutching me, choking me.

WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

Even then i remeber i did participate in talent show type thing where i did magic with lakshay chauchan, I SUCKED, and it wasn't that good, but I didn't stuuttered nor was i sad after evemy. NULL.

I even remeber maybe it was Pooja Mam who said to me, Esha mam will be so proud if she saw that.

It made me so happy.

FOR MOM & DAD, IT WAS JUST SO EASY FROM STAND FROM PEDESTAL AND INSTRUCT, JUST REMAIN IN THEIR OWN EGO,

THEY NEVER CAME DOWN TO MY LEVEL & talk to me,

Or if they think i don't know how to talk

Say to me - Why don't you first maybe say xyz this and then try to talk about, you make cartoon off me.

NO! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK. YOU ARE SHY.

Why do you fear? or why don't you want to? is there an event you want to participate in?

Why are you shy. What makes your think obliging to their will is above your's own will, one wants, own desires.

What have this done for you till now, what will it do in future?

THEY NEVER ASKED ME THAT

They turned into a fault in me. A fault in my character.

THEY ALL JUST DISCOURAGED ME.

One time i rember in english mam was our PTM teacher, mom talked about me not participating.

Mam mentioned must be due to Totla wali problem.

NO! IT WASN'T PROBLEM YET. And i felt another identity-restriction imposed on me, BUT I MADE MENTAL NOTE I WON'T LET IT EAT ME.

I remeber why somya's word motivated me so much on that day of Extempor-ish type compettion, IT WASN'T LOVE.

She saw me, she looked at the human me.

She was talking TO ME. The others were only to image and pet or object.

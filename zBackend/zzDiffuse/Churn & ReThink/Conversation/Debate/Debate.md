# Debating Principles
## Intelligence vs wisdom
If intelligence is the ability to respond to any argument,
wisdom lies in knowing which arguments to respond to,
and which parts of an argument to respond

## People have infinite differences
Arguments are easy to start and hard to end because there are any number of differences between two people.
You have to be careful to say
"We're having this disagreement at this moment
and not all the other disagreements we could be having,"

## Four Laws
1. Is it Real or Misunderstanding
2. Is it important ***enough*** to justify disagreement
3. Is it specific enough OR too broad
4. Are you aligned in your goal. 
Limitation
- won’t work if both are out there to hurt/demean/harm other


> [!Error] Don’t START ARGUMENT if there are too TOO MANY STRANDS - You’ll make yourself look dumb
> Ask them to address all one by one don’t be like a child SCREAMING that this and that and that.
> Here are my points
> Tell me precisely your points.

## See them as FORMAL CONTRACT
**"This is what we're disagreeing about,
and these are the reasons
why we're engaging in that dispute."**
> [!Example] This helps against those who try to
> 1. Twist words
> 2. Make disagreement about what it wasn’t about
> 3. Expand the debate
> 4. Change topic

"Are you really in this,
hoping to persuade me to change my mind?"
That bit of negotiation of why it is that we're in the conversation in the first instance can often allow our conversations to go better than if we just jump into the disagreements without much forethought.

> 2. And if it's not, is us challenging it going to help us make progress on the overall dispute?

- No matter how offensive or wrong-seeming it may be, by asking whether it's first necessary to challenge or even if it's not whether challenging,
- You needn’t be in disagreement/fight to resolve - PERHAPS discussion is better

## Listening most important
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN FIRST TO BE HEARD - not superficial BUT REAL 
<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 
The first is, it is in your best interest
to understand the opposition's argument
as they would understand it.
It's not in your best interest

**to twist their meaning
or to take it at its worst
or to capture only a fraction of it**
*you can stop other party from doing it by pointing it*

because they won't feel as though
they had been listened to
and heard and ultimately responded to.
<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 

it's also in your best interest
to respond to the strongest version of the other side
and sometimes to build up the other side's case
so that it's even better than where they have it now.
You know after you finish speaking,
the opposition might have a 'light bulb'
and **come up with a better case**,
or someone on their side might say,
"You've responded to the weak version of this argument
but here's something better."
\

## Preprepartion
1. Coming up with the best possible arguments that you can to sell the truth of your side to the listener.
2. Put themselves in their opponent's shoes and write the four best arguments for the opposing side. 
3. To look over their case again, this time through the eyes of someone who fervently disagrees with them to identify all of the flaws and the criticisms that could be leveled against them.
4. imagine a world: in which they lost the debate, and to come up with the reasons why they did.

'These side-switch exercises,' puts a pause on that feeling of certainty. It makes us feel, for a moment, the subject of reasonableness of other people's beliefs. It gives us that moment where we get back on our toes and think maybe we missed something.





# Dirty debaters  
how quickly that could be turned into a kind of a brawl,
where the only thing that mattered was the display and the spectacle of dominance over the other side, where embarrassment was the currency.
Those darker impulses that feed into bad disagreements
## The Dodger
we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels because climate change is getting out of hand.
**Then they might say on the topic of climate change,**
why do you drive a four wheel drive?

And so the response to the dodger is to stay the course and to keep bringing the discussion back to the original point and highlighting that they are trying to change what the disagreement is about.

## The Twister
Misrepresent the point that you'll making. If you say I'm opposed to increasing taxes,
**the twister might say**
does that mean you have no concern for social security?

It's not the argument you are raising,
it's the one they're thrusting on you.

To respond to the twister,
it's imperative to correct the record and say “no, that's not what I'm saying.“ You can often get into a position of arguing for something you don't believe, or at least the conversation's splitting and you not being able to connect and talk about the same issue.

## The Wrangler
They're very good at coming up with critiques against just about everything that you're saying,
but they never offer an alternative of their own.

And so the appropriate response to the wrangler is to say
well, what do you believe?

**In other words, to pin them to a position so that they too have to argue in favor of something rather than always saying no.**

## The Liar
The strategy against a liar is to choose one or two representative lies that you think best exemplifies the approach that the liar is taking in a disagreement.
Then debaters do something called plug and replace.
You replace the lie with a truth, and so by plugging in the lie and then replacing it with the truth,
you can demonstrate the ways in which the lie falls short and try and explain how that symptomatic of a broader approach that the liar is taking to the debate.

# Vocabulary Use
1) First thing let’s stop - You have made narrow minded assumptions of what i’m saying and you are twisting it in any way
2) Let me put where my point is that is in conflict with you. “Are slavery and freedom interlinked. if you give an creature more privelegge and opportunites than he will ever get in his lifetime, he isn’t being treated cruely CAN YOU STILL CALL IT SLAVERY”
3) I never said any of that - you just made assumptions before even knowing what argument is

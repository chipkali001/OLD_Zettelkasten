I'll give it a little bit of preface um now I'll just go right into it I tossed and turned in bed but couldn't fall asleep as every night since my personal tragedy happened in midsummer of that same year my son had been suffering from a severe depression for several months and I did some time fear the worst so when my wife called me at work on that evening and said that his room was locked and he wouldn't respond to calling his name and knocking on the door death immediately reared in my mind and my heart palpitated with a pang I shouted my son is dead and I started sobbing savagely and uncontrollably my secretary drove me home someone climbed to the rear window of his room and broke it then immediately screamed to call the paramedics Leora her name's really judy, judy ran to guys room the secretary following on the steps Judy came out of the room crying hysterically her paint throbbing around me the paramedics came and she reentered the room with them but they could only confirm guy's death I held even more but did not have the strength of mind to even think about entering guy's room I ran up and down back and forth in the house i sat I stood up against at again lay down on the floor and twisted in all forms and directions but I could not escape the terrible situation I screamed for my son and hope that he would immediately come out of the room I saw Judy breaking out from guy's room dashing past everyone in the corridor ripping out her hair and rushing to her bedroom door slamming behind her and I still twisted around in frenzy this is not true how do I get out of this nightmare my mind raged where do I hide now for eternity at nights I could not sleep daydreaming deliriously about my son conversation and activity with me during the day I had to face all those annoying friends and colleagues who honestly with good intentions were torturing me with the meaningless words all of them repeated endlessly as if they had rehearsed together you have your family to take care of as well as your police work be strong what's calling me but that one 800-number is worse thing as if I needed to be told all this we're not for these cursed obligations I would emulate guys suicide and be immediately released from the pain and anyway how could i betray his memory by tending to things as meaningless and trivial as personal achievement status and career the constant unbearable relentless pain weighing down on my chest like a hundred tanks parked on it and the need to perform work and other daily duties was now utterly meaningless to watch people going places coming back talking and toiling for reasons that now completely escaped me what is the meaning of all this hassle and tussle I'm dead and these people continue their daily occupations and I have to watch them and they're utterly stupid ambitions and activities to get rich to be powerful to do this and that what for as life has already ended and why is it that I'm dead and they're alive and why is it they have sons to continue their existence after they're gone and where's mine while performing my duties as a lawyer here at police inspector when it's lawyer really I would feel sad enraged empty-headed and exalted concurrently or alternate are alternatively why can't I also depart after guy maybe I will find him somewhere when I call him back in my dreams he only signals that it was time for him to go on with his passage and not for me I have family duties a city's population to protect here the same population who couldn't honestly give a [ __ ] about guys death anyone understood the city's treatment of beat the weeks and months passed black horror settled in my mind my own darkness engulfed sucked it suffocated me inescapable misery constantly bashing my heart dashing wounds of unbearable pain memories of my son melted my brain like butter and boiling vapor driving me insane and the worst was the impossibility the absolute impossibility to run away and to vanish it disappear there was nowhere to hide accept it bless his sleep came to me some nights after many hours of twisting in my bed no appetite for food for sex your achievement whatsoever no ambition to make even the slightest advance only the burden in my chest getting heavier every day and the nagging dread that in time I will forget Guy desert him that's why I continued living his dump like a zombie horrific not only the loss of my son but mainly the loss of my old securities of the confident man I used to think I was tougher of it I carefully read it take your time slowly I began realizing that I was separated from life because my son was my life and he would never return I'd lost my connection to the part of myself that could not we thought my son satisfied I'm more than that part of myself which my son had reflected I'm orange for me this was the unfolding of the simple realization of why I felt dead among the living I went to the kitchen took a sleeping pill sagged back inside my bedroom and sank into a welcome dreamless sleep

It will devolve into catfight, i wanted to brutalise and win permanent

maybe Pooja Mam didn't liked me as much cuz of another incident (devrath tanuj)

I am getting siderailed here

Actually devrath tanuj were from A section and in bus they were poking me and making fun of me.

I actually felt excited 

No actually that was a lie, i am told myself, 

In that time i used to think i am so strong noone of my age can defeat me in fight

-It excited me so much.

So i actively seek fight and Conflict but but 

-There is a problem in fight that if i defeated someone badly then that person will carry resentment and anger against me which he will take in small forms or ocassional burst.

And didn't satisfy my ego satisfaction.

I was really cautious perosn and i willnt want someone to carry resentment against me it willnt yield any good if i have an shared pace where regular metting will happen. Its literally inviting disaster.

Win with total domination and brutality that other person surrenders in spirit not only in body. He should not have any fighting spirit or hate against me.

and in bus it's not possible cuz that paced is too cramp there is too many people and i cant use brute force. 

And if i am beating him till he break his confidence and spirit i am so high it will take time and kids will grab each other and pull back and all left will be resentment karmic strings 

To have a moral pedestal over we stand and not my ego.

What i mean to say is difference between 

 fight over two things

-   You made fun of me or i made fun of you and i got angry and we start fighting 
-   You or i gave a mother gali and you or i and you or i resort to violent on basis kuch tumne kah kaise Diya.

This type of fight resentment has ess chances of perpetuating into future

Suppose i give you or you give me 

Example - i say an mother wali gali to me. You beat me over that 'how dare you/ maa ki gali kaise dedii' and you kicked and beat you until you are in the ground.

-Now the next time we see each other 2 days later, i will feel lot of anger but but you willnt attack me even when my back is open to you.

Why? Cuz i am in moral superiority. So chances are less of exacting resentment..

-We can reduce them further

And if i see you with anger again looking at me then 

MY ANGer becomes invalid 

NOW IF YOU HAVe DONE the opposite look at me and give me a smirk

My anger will become valid 100% it's not logic i am asking you to think of emotions

—-

Coming back currently they were poking me and laughing and pinching. 

It's not a condition where i can beat them up and claim COMPLETE VICTIMHOOD.

It's a cat fight scenario where they are just scartching each other.

—

So i allowed the reaosn for resentment to pile upI can't hit then just yet, i should let them do more of what 

I reached school 

When i was sitting on backbench they entered from backdoor i noticed from corner of eyes but feigned ignorance and acted like i am studying.

I recieved a slap from behind it didn't hurt much but slap is still a slap

I WAS INTERNALLY LIKE YES! yES!

Bus mei kb koi aur nhi dekh rhs to baat alag hai per class Mai izzat ki baat aajati hai and i have moral superiority 

So i grabbed the bigger and stronger of them used my hand to lower his neck and beat him on back until his knees cave in and he collapsed on the ground.

And stopped resisting and fighting.

He had prideful, competitive personality so keeping him on ground requires me to break his will .

So even after he was on ground he tried to get up so i kicked him

……

When i looked up again 

Class Wale bacho ne arc bna liya tha aur sb waha see dekh rhe thee

……

The smaller one took a distance and held a chair as a shield.

…..

I walked towards him but he ran back and took uturn and i didjt went ahead further to chase him cuz if i run after him and we move in circle and i vant ultimate catch him, it will look silly.

 delaying the fight will make devrath gets up again and we again fight 

I had crossed HE DIDN'T EVEN Inflicted 3% of PAIN TO ME. I had already crossed lines and limit of what my victim card will allow to defend again

So me beating him further will make his anger bigger than 

MY VICTIM STATUS CAN PROTECT ME AGAINST.

So i took the decision of going towards where everyone was standing in line 

Now one another problem was there that teachers may beat me cuz all the did was pinching and playful slap while i was more brutal and violent 

SO TEACHER WILL HAVE EVERY REASON TO PUNISH US BOTH

I BEHAVEd VERY ANIMALISTICALLY

The whole class saw that me beating then badly. 

So information will perpetuate i am sure teachers will be informed by one of my classmate who saw the fight.

Ki class mai fight hui thi devrath tanuj agrim ke bich mei.

Phir mam mujhe bulaungi, unhe blueaygi aur kahaniya sunegi, and i was terribly shy kids so jb mujhe itni saare long ghur rhe hai, mere andar see awaj nhi niklengi aur dono ko maar padegi 

Now even if i say something, the two temp didn’t do any brutal violent and act and there acts were more teasing, laughing and poking. And I acted barbaric and brute (and was secretly wanting physical violence) so higher probability teacher may beat us both.

SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO NOT STAY A SINGLE WORD (I am shy)(MAIN GOAL)AND NOT GET BEATEN?

From the arc i went close to few of my friends

And i began to speaki n little loud voice.

(I dont’r remeber wording, i sepwsing out the esccesnce)

Ye dono bs meri mera bhot time see dimag kharab kr rhe hei (Half-lie)

SUbhe see yee mujhe bus mei preshan kr rhe thee aur abhi mei pdh rha tha aur mujhe aachankar see picche see maara.

I was little loud so others will hear me cause they were near and this half-lie story will spread

TO MAKE SURE i AM NOT TOUCHED

 i started telling few of my classmates with little anger about how they were bullying me in bus and now they came and hit me.

I WAS AN Sincere and dillegent kid in STUDY and devrath tanuj were outlaws type of Perdonality and imagine in front of all teachers 

SO If i selled them MY PROPOGANDA SO THE STORY TEACHER WILL HEAR WILL BE OF mE BEING VICTIM.

And even if it's not my classmates will stand for me. Justice ke liye.

WHAT happened next wa the two of them tot up and plunged at army of kids that were still forming an arc but kids grab thema DN strated beating then, laat, jute aur maar maar kr bahar nikala.

Cuz they were still trying to fight and they all were beating then, pulling hair, beating.

Class-teacher Mam made me stand up and called me in kind voice and called devrath tanuj from other section.

Mam gave them good scolding or beating i don't remeber exactly it's vague but mam didn't spare then any kindness

They went back and after few minutes passed 10-15min their class teacher came and she was angry I Didn't knew her exact words but she saw them as victim as they were beaten up by whole class, unki uniform bhi gndi hogyi thi

at me a little i can see that in her eyes? I

 wonder why she didn't belive in my innocence? She was just being territorial?

Or maybe she actually never received story of me being tragic heroine? Maybe she heard but was paranoid.

 Why was she angry

And the way she looked at me i was scared because i felt like mam can see my soul.

Maybe she can see that me playing victim card or maybe she was just territorial.

ALL of  YHAT REMaINS MYSTERY TO TILL THIS DATE.

NO IT WASN’T LIKE I HAD TO THINK TOO DEEPELY MY INTUTION WAS GUIDING ME WHAT SHOULD I DO TO ESCAPE. I JUST FOLLOWED INTUTION.

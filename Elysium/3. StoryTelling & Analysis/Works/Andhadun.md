Opening piano playing man have a cat
appears blind 
Child throw  something on me - we’re like that’s mean
Get’s haircut
Thanks waitress in polite way has very calm personality & appears smart

Scene switches to family of three home looks very nice- beuatiful wife & daughter.
Father is recording wife cooking 

Then husband maybe intrudes into wife’s room or say something - but wife is super offended (precursor to what’s about to happen)

Our protag ends up getting hit by daughter riding scooter
She worry say’s are you alright
khi chod skti hun? kuch kr skti hun aapke liye?

Then we see scene switching to two of them sitting in an restuaurant
Take dog with you.
Cat’s already a handful 

Piano play mc tell
FL like - PIANO? aacha bajate hon.
*(Good way to reveal he has cat, without making an info dump coming from MC.
If MC is all like yeah listen i use ABC magic or i knbow XYZ out of blue looks like info dump BUT 
if an discussion is already ongoing (about blindness of MC)
In that discussion - an exclamaton/worry/concern/SARCASM come (Why don’t you take dog with you))*
*NOW FL needs pianist so IT AIN’T GOOD FOR HER TO BE Like i’m looking for pianist. 
MC must say piano then FL be like OH! I AM LOOKING FOR
& MC appears/acts/really-is OBLIVIOUS
How did you find him?
By accident)*

On way home, we see scene - MC tells ball hit him, optical nerve damaged, blind (*good way to fill time*)
(budding romance indicator by -
Tum isse adhura kyu samjhte hon 
kuch chize adhure hone ki wajah see puri hoti hain)

After fateful encounter with FL
both romance initial state of starting to bud
And us feeling bad for MC’s blindness 
WE LEARN - HE AIN’T BLIND
*way to deliver shock factor*


MC meets FL to go to home for piano
MC sunglasses gets shit open.
MC sings in an megA-RICH PEOPLE Personal resturant or Lounge (party isn’t going, but father & a artist(who draw MC sketch is present) is present

Earns RESPECT & ADORATION of father by saying 
Sir your voice matches Pramod Sinha (Noone has told him that, and he is blind so he sohould have no way to know)

When come back from megA-RICH PEOPLE Personal Lounge/ and giving awesomne performance

MC drops something remeber so come back to pick it up (FL dropped him off)
Kid see & learn by mistake - he ain’t blind (in future he will spy, record & GIVE RECORDING TO ==FL== at the wrongest of time, and it will even get amped up further by mother telling they slept together to cover up why MC is down)
*awesonme trick - deliever what all viewers is like FL shouldn’t know this - AT ==WRONGEST OF **ALL TIME**== - 
COMBINE it with
*IT being where MC NEEDS her ==MOSTEST OF **ALL TIME**== (he is out cuz was poisoned)** 
And chance of that **pure thing that could have been protect and story nicely advanced** 
EVEN NOW readers scream OH PLEASE FL NOTICE! mc needs you! please notice! you learning it wrong itme is **==distractingyou==** (not ~~blind~~ but ==DISTRACT==)
Tension remains up in whole scene by everyone screaming FL please NOTICE.
BUT SHE DOESN’T INSTEAD this time what she learns isn’t ACTUAL OLD BETRYAL BUT ==TRUTH== (**somthing MC isn’t to blame, that misunderstanding is preventying you from protecting ==MC or that oure thing being destroyed==**)
> [!Attention] trope of hiding lie works well - cuz we see the non lying party is SO **PURE-KIND** in INTENTION or **SO DEPENDENT**

Now next time 
**MC IN PARTY**
where MC sing
We see MC & FL lil more closer, MC is crossing hands behind FL in scooter

Now *Nextest time* 
==1== Foreshadowing- FL’s father tell come to my home tommorow (he dies find and everything goes awry after that, good was happening cuz MC and FL had union the previous day)
**BACK to normallness of lounge where Mc was shown to play - father asked are you pramod sinha**
MC & FL together enjoy
**come back home both drenched in RAIN**
==2== ==increasing shock factor even more by showing scene== of FL mom & dad just chilling. dad watches his own movies (shows maybe how much he loves himself(not a bad man, nor narrsicitic, just likes seeong)
there were also his own poster on wall
==foreshadowing== - you love seeing that girl getting murdered murder hwo many times have you seen her get murdered)

**MC fl both comes drecned in rain**
FL start changing in front of MC (he is supposed to be bling)
but MC is good person so he excuses himself out that he’ll change
(We’re like yes he is a **gentlemen**)
He changes in his room
Shown that Fl comes to door 
& peak at MC’s hot body - he is supposed to be blind.
FL continue looking little while.
Then FL knocks on door.
*Do you have wine opener?*
Wine drink
MC & FL maybe plays some kind of game
which ends with MC saying - You Win!
FL drunk, tries playing piano and keeps on dropping stuff
MC shouts why are you dropping! what are you doing!
Then FL tries be like MC in blindfold.
FL tries to go pickup wine, but MC mischeviously moves (fl don’t know - he ain’t blind-)
I thought i left it there
MC shouldn’t know FL is wearing eye mask acc to FL
so continue lie MC touches eye mask on FL face to be like (*fl guided mc’s hand to eye mast*)
Oh! tumne eye mask pehna tha.
Fl then still continue hold MC’s hand on eyemask.
Ask Mei kaisi lg rhi hun.
Take MC’s hand from face mask - into her mouth and sucks on one of his finger)
Next scene FL on MC lap, but on top of his lap, so it’s Fl at little higher height , MC looking up too meet lips and kiss. FL ain’t wearing a top


MC next day goes to meet dad as plan
Mom says - he went to banglore (we aren’t told yet &  series isn’t giving much direct hint for us to guess ahead to deliever MAX SHOCK)
MC says he asked me to meet him yesterday
Mom takes MC in
I’ll phone Pramod
My God! You should have told me
tell me
When i was 14 a cricket ball to my eye, damaged my optic nerve
A cricket ball hit my eye when i was 14 and damaged my optic nerve.
Mom wall against lean
(we think she is enjoying ourselves but we see her looking at legs of someone(body not shown, but we immediately know it’s her husband))
*nice stuff(show but not tell, little ambiguity maintain - drunk, dead - is it father or someone else*
MC ask to go to bathroom.
She takes him. 
In bathroom buffed police loaded gun on back, mc continues to act blind.
Now on way back.
We see bloodied corpse / corpse covered in blood.
**Story recall** - father comes with flowers and gun at odd time to be SUPRISE!
Mom comes out with her fixing the draping strap of her hot-camisole
and men wearing his belt.
(we are left to thinking what happened to father - did he shot himself? most probably YES!)
MC continues to play 
Mom & men are clearing blood fixing accessories. 
Mom then claps says Beautiful to create more distrcation
Mom & men pushes dead corpse in bag.
**They take out his watch**
She even plays sound-recording of her-daughter saying Bye mummy and stuff cuz (she thinks mc is blind, so they are feeding him false story)

Then we see mom crying (shows dad indeed did sucide)

MC goes to police station
I’m here to report killing
Same men appear - we learn he is cop.
MC immediately changes sbjuect to it’s his cat that died


COP body is really bluff.
COP drives him back to his home
but before car start wife comes & questions Tumhara phone bnd kyu hain
(we learns he has a wife and we feel even sadder)
COP - chlo baad mein baat krte hain


MC enters says - Sir coffee
cop test - moves hand (up to down) in front of his face
We see MC calling to his cat 
Rani! 
(this was just coverup for mc to pickup his blind contact lens)
Cop start to check around 
Then 
Cop test2- *takes an knife in his hand and hold in his hand ready to swing it*
MC is in middle of and is sayying Last week he tied a firecracker to rani's tail. She ran amok 
*and throw it by swinging knife spinning which pierces the door* 

MC goes to party, mom is there too, mc is playing piano

TV report scene switch - They found dad in car, out there to make a deal, with millions of .
Next scene
They **fix up an normal citizen (fx1)** by setting **watch of dad in toilet** and blame him.
Then we see our police beating him.

Next scene police station
Police gathered for meting report.
We see **fixed-man (fx1)‘s wife & daughter** who were crying, wfie wiping nose  
MC now enters and sit down
**now false story narration start**
A random police officer tells
*I arrived at 1pm sharp.
Pramodji came ten minute later*
We see scene of MC 
SUDDENLY GETTING
Sb jhut hain! 
In dono nei mil kr pramod ji ka murder kiya hain
Body ko pack krdiya hian bag ke andar.
Snapped his finger to remove his ring
Aankhein deekho meri - mujhe dekhti hain - dekhti hain mujhe
then we learn it was all in MC’s mind
Dialogue ‘I waited for a while but he did not come back’ by athat same andom cop who was narrating story from an paper continues to break our illusion.
==We are left life COME ON MAN!! SAY IT!! YOU CAN DO IT! REVEAL THE TRUTH==
> [!Attention] We see an shocking or Scene everyone wanted - only to learn it was all in imagination or just a dream. **BUT BUT WHOLE TIME WE WERE WATHCING THE SCENE UNFOLD NOT FOR A** ==SPLIT SECOND== anyone suspects it’s happening in a ==DREAM/IMAGINATION== 
> you should definately be using this this trick
> ==USED IN JOKER TOO==
- You can also use this trick of ==We are left life COME ON MAN!! SAY IT!! YOU CAN DO IT! REVEAL THE TRUTH== wielding them together is good. or CREATE SENSE OF ==SADNESES over realising it can’t be true now==

MC plays at funeral
Mom gives speech and trips up little as she reaches end of speech (we know PEOPLE NOTICE it’s all lie, please see it)
Then an old lady goes to cop in funeral and says 
Simi nee jhuut bola, …
Cop ain’t beliving her
We even she looking at MC
(*WE ARE LEFT LIKE ==OLD LAY==* talk to akash he knows stuff ==PLEASE MEET BOTH OF YOU==) 

> [!Attention] this trope of luring reading into being like JUST MEET - HE/SHE has one key THAT will solve this whole MESS in ==ONE CLINK== all sadness, ==unfairness, voilation== everything will disappear with just one

**Next scene**
We see women trying to convince cop to look into it with more effort and discretion you’ll will get promoted.
This is an high profile case.
But cop she is telling ot is actual criminal so 
WHOLE TIME WE ARE LIKE “Lady, he is the criminal!”

**NExt scene**

WE KNOW NOTHING WHAT HAPPENED Next left in dark.
Then we see MC getting up.
(WE”RE LIKE OH! NO! they did took his kidney?)
> [!Attention] Good strategy of not saying third eye dialogue in that scene cuz it willn’t be good and too drastic- vibe mood energy change too unnatural - leaving mystery for next day -lil bit ambiguity is the best

OMG (He must have third eye)
MC tries to pretend he can see and predict stuff

**Next day**
We see killermom scolding COP - wo bol to skta hian na abhi bhi
Then on reaching home - she sees akash playing piano
She takes him to his car

OR
I’ll tell everyone in media
Huh? Blackmail
> [!Attention] Whole time you dthink, no dude that’s stupid why’ll she listen to you, she has already killed (would have been more fun if MC was oblivious that she is pyscopath & sees that her husband shot himself and she feels lil sad, just in bad situation, if mc thought she isn’t that bad & doesn’t know she didn’t send COP it’ll all be SO SO FUN)

Then suddenly an taxi blocks road under bridge

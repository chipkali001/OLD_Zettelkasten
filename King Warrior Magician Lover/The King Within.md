# The King Within
The center of cosmos, manisfesting the creative ordering
King would THE CENTER OF WORLD - an stable axis.
They believe earth plane would degrade into sterility & chaos.
That's why they would call forth - the sacred divine energy to BLESS the world - to provide **FIRMNESS** , **STABILITY** & **FERTILITY**

Steward the creations had entrusted him 
His ultimate purpose was WORLD-BUILDING.
To provide an nurturing-fertile place where <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">life & beauty</mark> can bloom

Energy felt when first handing over plate - then guiding with fingers to what to do - without saying a word - King-Warrior 

Theme of king - FIRST Restoring Order in a CHOATIC WORLD- then - Ruling over it. 
Egypt Mythology - 
1) king being revived by his wife, who brings order back to world - which his brother had thrown down path of destruction after his death. 
2) King God being born after creation who BRING all the other gods into this worlds 
3) Kings had been seen as an holy-vessel of divine energy - a part of god which will return to heavens after his death and reincarnate again into heir
4) Tibetain King - expected to live HOLY ASCETIC LIFE - beyond all feminine charms & profane reality.
5) The Sun King, The Sage King, The Rain King
6) Jewish propher Jesus was transformed into archetype of King-God

A Man IDENTIFIED w/ KING ARCHETYPE is who unconsciously sacrifices himself of his family is an ineffective sacrifice. 
Like Jesus.
He isn't masochist cuz he would prefer to avoid painful death, but he understand the circumstances that demand his death-- he accepts it. 

Your Majexty - we pay respect both to PERSON & the MAJESTIC KINGSHIP he carried 

Caring isn't something exclusive to women - some men are threatened by idea of showing they care for something - ex Martin Luther King, Subhash Chandra Bose
Theirs was an aggressive, masculine, potent caring 
They are examples of what man can do when he responsibly uses POWER OF KING WITHIN

### CENTER  
The axis mundi (TREE OF LIFE - *Above which is heaven, below which is hell - the center is where humans live)* - 

**Making unconsious conscious. turns UNINTEGRATED psychological contents INTO potential gold creative transformations**

Incorporates 'sacred in profane' 'potential in actual' 'Infinite in finite'
RECONCILIATION & COMMUNICATION b/w the GOD-KING & MAN-KING is necessary 

We can't life an intense life without consiousness of our imminent death

### TRANSFORMING VESSEL
TURNING DIVINE ENERGY into HUMAN uSABLE FORM
==Woman throws  a man's masculine characteristics into **sharp contrast** with feminine.==

**King's sacred energy was preserved & prevented from getting contaminated by**
- Incestuous marriage
- isolating king's room in palaces & temples
- Inner sanctury would be protected by armed guards
- Origin of red carpet was keeping ROYAL FEET off the ground
- Taboos around touching king's crown

 **Ego structure equivalent of TRANSFORMER & SHIELD**
The concentration of king's energy in CONSENSETUALIZATION of EGO - protect it from REST OF PSYCHE & it's EXPANIVE LIBIDO. 
KEEPING it at an COGNITIVE & EMOTIONAL DISTANCE  from archetype

### PROCREATOR
Yes to LIFE/NEW/CREATIVITY - is phallic thrust of creation - DIVINE URGE TO PENETRATE the PROFANCE & SEED it with SACRED.
Procreation is EVENT which results IN OFFSPRINGS - IT'S AN ACT OF GENERATIVITY.
It can be both SEXUAL and in an SPIRTUAL sense .
**THE KING bless his SUBJECTS with SOUL this is what has been called BLESSING** (ex is parents blessing their children with an soul)
##### Blessing 
- Meaningful TOUCH
- Spoken Blessing
- Attachment of high-value to the other
Picturing for other a **SPECIAL-FUTURE** and **ACTIVE-COMMITMENT** to the other to help realize that future. 
- When an mentor looks at you, his gaze is an **act of blessing** - he supplies you with **something you wish your parents had supplied** 
	How patients after seeing their therapist - their depression lifts and they feel vital & capable for 2-3 days before FALLING-BACK into their OLD-PATTERNS until their **NEXT APPOINTMENT**
##### THE VITALITY COMES from simply BEING WITNESSED
##### You can bless yourself too, give yourself vitality that comes from being witnessed. 
THIS is not an wuwu stuff - BUT BASED on REAL THERAPY **MEDITATION** - Dr. Bernie Siegle asks his 
CANCER PATIENTS (they aren't normal people - one who have suffered and endured so much - the pain of chronic illness - life being cut short - women loosing her hair(imagine how much it must hurt)) to STAND NAKED before a MIRROR. 
He tells them to keep looking until they find something about their bodies, they can really love - it doesn't have to be too much - starting from small part of body & he ask them to extend this to their whole body - **taking as much time as necessary** - until they can say they their truly **LOVE THEMSELVES & THEIR ENTIRE BODY**


> [!Attention] You can try it yourself
> LOOK IN THE MRROR - try giving yourself THE KIND OF DEEP COMPASSIONATE look you'd GIVE AN LOVED ONE or Maybe the LOOK you've always wanted to GET.
> > [!Quote] The compassion you have wanted is already IN YOU - you don't need to go anywhere - you can let your tears fall - empower yourself - BLESS YOURSELF
###### The king's sacrificial-death is procreative. It nourishes the earth as FERTILLIZING SEMEN.

There can't be NO CREATION OF **NEW KINGDOM** without SELF-SACRIFICE - let your blood fall & let it nourish & wash you (like self-sacrificing of SAMURAI/WARRIOR(they did that), self-sacrifice of christ, sacrifice of goat)
**Choices of any kind for anything** - is form of **self-sacrifice** - you sacrifice POTENTIAL for SAKE OF SOMETHING ACTUAL.
1. Think of lust, hunger, sleep --> you are **SACRIFICING** your kingdom - for sake of your body
2. An artist can paint Infinite things on canvas - yet he chooses & sacrifices potential for actual
##### The SACRED-KINGS who embodied this FORCE were SEEN as STEWARD not only of The SOCIAL Order but The NATURAL ORDER - that's why they were sometimes even referred to as the "DIVINE GARDENER"


### Structurer
- Build & put things in order - Through laws & customs. - Discovering science/technology/theology/craftsmanship/artistry
- Translating **TONGUE OF GOD** into PICTOGRAPH & RUNES.
> [!Attention] Oracles have **lamented conditons** on earth - when there's **lapse** in continuity of **a sacred kingship** 
> Without the STRONG-KING's structurer mode HUMAN-SOCIETY will face **COLLAPSE** OF 
> Human morals, Ethical values, Social Cohesiveness, Orderliness of the Natural World. All of which is APPARENT in THE CURRENT WORLD
 - Making people realize their VALUES & PRINCIPLES they hold but LACKED words for it. 
PYRAMIDS were rerferred to as STAIRWAYS meant to aid the PHARAOH'S ascension to THE HEAVENS. Golden capstone was an image of sun. 
DRAWING IMAGE OF PHAROAH'S SOUL UP TO MIND OF GOD.
This is the reason consiousness is depicted as ascending -- it takes tremendous effort to become conscious - The ultimate SOURCE OF LIGHT is always above us (like sun) - We must look up in order to be conscious


## Generative Man
All the risk, wealth he accumulates, are finally designed to care for and sustain his family and community. 

##### HIS Healing properties helps the DISABLED
##### HE Provides - A Vision For Us
He encourages & **confirm** their individuality   the reality of **their suffering** and **their joy** 
Because he is himself SECURE & CENTERED - he can allow others to be themselves.  
Rather than belittle he supports them 
(Provides an confirming face - in other words, he mirrors and blesses. )

Not easily thrown off balance - his integrity is such - sarcasm, innuendo, accusation & confrontation have little effect on him. 

When wrathful response is called for, he act aggressively. 

His truthful  words/action help others feel their own reality & get sense of their own authentic being. 

He seeks to free himself of envy

Self sacrificing.

Help others build their own kingdom.

Engaged in quest for wholeness & moral seriousness. 

> [!Success] His opposite impulses are reconciled at his center - and he helps others to do the same. 

> [!Success] Provides stability to those who come to him - looking for order in themselves 


## Welcoming the King Force in our lives
"God is a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere."

Think of time - you felt life has become dull, uninteresting, sterile.
Getting together w/ boys for abc wasn't fun, vacation to ABC felt flat, ...

**WHAT WE REALLY NEEDED** was to get back in touch **with** the **"waters of life"** 

"You are what you think"
"The Secret"
"Be careful what you ask for; you might get it."
"The Subconscious Mind"
**We can access power of** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">UNCONSIOUS-FORCES</mark> **through IMAGES**

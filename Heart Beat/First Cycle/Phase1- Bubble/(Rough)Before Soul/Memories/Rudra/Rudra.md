I was accused for spilling acid on harsh hand by rudra

Falsely accused by rudra that i have not letting him studyy and hampering him


I was shoked at he will tell me this.
Rudra was complex creature, entitled but not narrcistic and very chalu but to all this have very childishness to it , which all felt, weird to my brain.
Mam being favourite of big chunk of our class you know kids will surround him and ask him questions about man and he will boast about america so i guess always.
And he was jealous and hostile to me cuz i was only one in males good in studying and arts stuff so he saw me as hostile competition.
Koi usske upar mazak yaa bezaati nhi krega. 
So he always moved with pride and entitlement.
Through blackmailing him i was able to bring him down and dismiss  some of hostility.
And it's very weak position for me to be in cuz he was part of all groups in which i was part was and out of jealousy & hostility, he can easily humiliate me 
And a group scenario where 
I am alone and Everyone will speak in his favour since they like mam and won't want to be on her bad side.
It's a very weak position to be in.
So so so i resorted to blackmailing,
I can say all thing that he do or say.i cant recall any specific but on few occasion i told him (that what you were talking about girls and i even got him beaten few times and he didn't came to school next day so ugh..)
He was very childlike an animal i can't control him.
I even named him diaper and manypokopants, you know its ad has an white colour fluffy angel type rudra kind of looked similar.
So i was able to draw out pall his degenracy and 
But wild animal keeps on utilising opportunity to attack me and i know all his attacks better than him.
With him i always felt like i am an human trying to make friend with a wild animal i had optimism that eventually i will be able to become friends and bring good out.
 which he did lot of times
Like maybe we get caught for something he will put the blame on me instantly OBVIOUSLY i KNEW HIS NATURE SO i was prepared most of times to put blame 
But i was disappointed 


But but lof times, he got opportunity to set me up when i wasn't even there at scene. I noticed changes in mams behaviour. 
I know he is misrepresenting me. I can't poke holes until i know what to poke holes at.

But now things have come to this.




(((Yes sometimes he will entered an higgteened state where he will reach mania and looses all the filter of what is okay to say.
And he will just say all stupid things))


 Wo jo rhe hain, tum bhot famous hon, you know
Me tumse bhot time see baar Krna chahta tha pr mouka nhi mila
.


And now he has fallen this low to me, he has become so degenrade that he is open enough to share this.

I felt monika mams evaluation of me has fallen down with time, it's rudra probably who whisper.

Rudra chalu usme dosti ke koi usul nhi pata thee.
Just line mei rkhne keliye ki wo uchle na. Kyi baar wo uchl jata thaa aur mei phir usse pitwata thaa, mam usse bhot bura daat daat kar Marti thi, ek baar pitne kee baad wo 2-3 din tk nhi aaya




Rudra Bubbly and didn't have filter of what he is saying when e got into excited state i noted all down so later i can blackmail no it won't be right word, but he just started acting so friendly when i told him his profound words back 
That kept him from jumping atleast most of times


**I DONT HAVE RIGHT WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT**
Rudra hate me or saw me as comepition kind of?
Blackmail not right word, mo it’s more of when you have some dirt on someone you can foster a playful dimension and friendliness.
But with entitlement you have to make sure you are not acting as if you have full control of person and you understand them fully, it will hurt their ego.
I understand you-arrogant 
I understand you- warmth 
\
His kind of competitivness was tamed or maybe suppressed little.

He was chidchida, ready to last out &e explode, and that blackmiling dont work against someone in that mood and since he has an negative feeling against me in his heart he can do something.
I wanted to know why is he so irritated and frustated and remove it out, but  i wasnt smart enough to manevour around someone’s big ego. and just make him direct those emotions towards things that really bothered him than me.

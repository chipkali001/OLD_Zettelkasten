In holi, in the afternoon after I had taken a bath, 

I just took a bath so maan colours see khelna nhi skta tha becoz mummy ne mana kiya tha

But still we (me and my neighbour) balloons man water bharne me to koi burai nhi na?

were standing on the edge of the highway throwing water balloons at people.

 A cheerful man who was on bike encouraged us to threw balloon on him and so we did but you know the collision it must have hit him pretty hard and it bounced off to other side of the road.

I thought what a shame and now i will have to go through trouble of retrieving the balloon and i was trying to cross highway road and go towards the place where our unbursted water balloon as we only had few limited water balloon left  but the bhiya on that bike stopped he ran towards us grabbed the balloon and threw it at me, it hurts like hell but still after that  it didnt burst I ran to the other side he picked up balloon and threw it on me again and this time it bursted i was wet all over again my neighbour was laughing at me. Mummy ne bhi phir data.

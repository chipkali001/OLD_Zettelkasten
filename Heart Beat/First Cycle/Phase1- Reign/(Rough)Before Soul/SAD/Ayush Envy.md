I envied Ayush, 
1) parth bhiya
2) he had lot of friends and just way everyone treated him felt like something i will want to feel what will it be like.
I wanted to be noticed and seen, i used to think maybe it's because he is high rank in study in top 3.
And i am nowhere near.
I wanted to get above him so i will be seen.
(I waited to go home and play video games)
3) 5th class i was very very happy, i misunderstood for so long why i was happy.
Earlier i blamed school that school was bad and blah blah.
But that wasn't the point.
It was that i felt acknowledged and seen by teachers and other kids in my class i felt seen like i am someone and sense of belonging which i wanted to feel in CJC, i saw ayush as a part of this.
In stanford i was praised for my efforts in study.
That need deep inside of me which was unfulfilled for so long was finally fulfilled
4) Even in stanford he seemed to mesh well and felt like more part of class than i was, i was so envious AND AND THAT EXPLAINS THE ANGER TOO WITH COC, when everyone in my class was playing what i used to PLAY, I WAS NO LONGER ALLOWED, when i thought i could finally be part of group. OPPORTUNITY WAS PLUCKED FROM ME.
Opportunity that would have given me so much joy perhaps i would have suffered far less loneliness, pain, abandonment type feeling.
	They all felt so connected and integrated part, they shared common unerstanding knowledge that i didnt understand but wanted to be part of.
	They collectively share so many things important to htier identity but my mother-father didnt did proper job if putting them in me, they both themselves suck in friendship

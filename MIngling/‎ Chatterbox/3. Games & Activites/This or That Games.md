THIS OR THAT GAMES

So there are few different ways you can play. The first variation works well with small groups or two people while the second works best with just two people.

Mind reader

This is a great game to see how well you know your friends. You’ll need a coin and a piece of paper to hide the coin.

Pick up the coin, ask the question, and place the coin down behind the paper. Heads up if you think their answer will be the first choice and tails up if you think it will be the second choice. Once everyone has made their guess the person answers. And everyone can reveals their coins.

Read a question to yourself and think of your answer. Then ask the question. If their answer matches yours, repeat the process. If they have a different answer than yours, switch it up and they read a question and think of their answer; then they ask you the question.

This variation is great for seeing how similar or different you are to the other person.

If you are looking to speed things up you can ask the question and both of you answer on the count of three and see if the answers match.

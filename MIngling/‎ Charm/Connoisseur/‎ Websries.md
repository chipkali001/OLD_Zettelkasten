# MoneyHeist 



# Flash
i thoroughly enjoyd the time i watched it but when i watched the new season after little break, i felt bored




# The family man
I like dialogues

Why can't he have job description he works in army and it's confidential for security of family and others?

He should have told terrorist he is in helpless situation nd surrounded by everywhere. Terrorist would have no choice to surrender.

OH SO SHE KNOWS HE WORKS OFR SECURITY.

THEN SHE HAS TO BE LITTLE UNDERSTANDING

Was kind of nice but i was more immersed in wheter the wife will cheat or not than the actual plot.

Peaky blinder- watched first episode.BORED

Still hooligan calls his mnnother whore and they start to fight.

Bss Hogya.

MAYBE I WAS TOO QUICK TO JUDGE BUT I DIDN’T DIND IT ENGAGING ENOUGH TO CONTINUE. I like too loose myself

I THINK I WAS TOO QUICK TOO JUDGE

I donm’t like gangster type films .(godfather - boring)


# Kingdom(2019)

Complete hooked, enjoyed it.

Season one ended at cliffhanger and i am looking forward to next season. I will maybe watch it on a good day


# LOCKE AND KEY

Nice but i don’t enjoy the kid protagonist and stuff.

‘




# Laughter in Waikikki

Episode1 - was good, they have too exaggerated emotions but htat must be a cultural thing so. It’s nice & FUNNY.


# Prison Break

Hmm… i liked it. Dialogues were nice BUT… ugh what did you liked about prison break was it a cunning protagonist? I have read lot of novels now so it felt normal to me,

So i liked to level where if i am watching i will watch next episode procastinating BUT i didnt have desire to just see what’ll happen in normal state or care or remebre if i have even finished it.



# LUCIFER
Enjoyed and want to watch season2.
When lucifer oblisously leak out what chloe said about her mom (childish & forced to grew up stuff) it was so funny



# Harry Potter 
I watched it in 12th.
I didn't like how Malfoy character cahnge between from.beiggning movie to 4th-5th.
He had kind of personality of being an prideful strong character.
But it changed into one who is bitter and looser-ish.
I hated that. I really like Malfoy character 


I abhore dumb character i like atleast story with charCter have some brain or at the very least some emotional-intellignence i guess it was made for kids so i shouldn't criticise

I HATED ROMANCE IN HARRY POTTER.

Harmione should be main heroine.
Or that girl that can too see thing Harry can see.
I didn't like drama around love. It annoyed me lot. 
I would have like more if other people weren't mixed. 
Only romance between two.

**half blood prince**
I didn't like how Ron started to call Hermione name in sleep.
There were no foreshadowing proper. He is shown oblivious so how come he takes names. 
I hate this kind of drama. If they have to do it make it something better.

The bond with Harry and ran's sister felt as if author is writting self-fuilment fanatsy between bestfriend & sister.
Jinny didn't felt like had much of personality, atleast enough level to be heroine.

It all felt like animals coming to each other to breed, i didn't felt like any romance buildup, just animal mating. Even romance between animals.will feel more beautiful.

now i believe what matter is will of  person, it hurts my brain to see-muttering name in sleep.
It felt super forced. He lacked any kind of resolve.
In beginning movies it was nice seeing him stand up to Malfoy for calling her muggel 


# Game OF THRONES
 GOT favourite character? 
Tyrion Lanister
Varys (humble talk everyone so nicely)
Jamie Lanister 
Jon snow is too simple so I don't really like
Leat like hated character? 
Sansa stark, I hated her character in beginning and I wanted to see her die, but she didn't, and later after 
Lady of winterfell it all  **author trying too hard, she just became smart all of sudden, she didnt shown to have any subtly or emotional intelligence not even proper calculating character not anywhere just an attempt to make look smart**
Arya saying sansa is smartest
You look at Margret tyrell, cersi, Tyrion, little finger, varys they all were smart and they didn't have to call themselves smart  but sansa felt pushed 
potrayong her as clever suddenly didn't felt real but artificial with author knows everything about world ast future present so they just have to make them look smart by making connections and it felt fakrly made. I wish she died there was some other character in place of her that would have been gun.
Same thing was with faceless men and arya stark little when she kills invites.

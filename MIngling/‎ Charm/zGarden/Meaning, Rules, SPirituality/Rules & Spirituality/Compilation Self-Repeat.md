Other people may already know what you're saying. dont assume superiority

Tiredness is a feeling one evokes when you feel a gargantuan amount of work needs to be done and by the end of the day you would have made miniscule progress so don't even bother 

False Assumption - body’s way of telling:- mini completion only 1% isn’t worth the effort @ end of it you won’t feel good.

On what basis is my mind making assumption that me moving 1 step forward and finally breaking out of my slump won’t be fulfilling

Desire for external object

Will is to become the most beautiful flower you possibly can

Burning process is so smooth, it’s same flame feel

For Maths, Music, physical skill learning. when you are in intense learning mode or full focus then every few minutes randomly pause for 10 seconds , don nothing (no thinking). The skill/concept neurons will replay @10x-20x speed. GIving you more repetitions.

More we value things outside our control,

The things we value control us

Unconsciousness is a sin. 

To be truly meditative, you have to be meditative all the time (You cannot arrange it in such a way that sometimes you breathe and sometimes you don’t breathe. It is a continuum.

Meditation cannot be apart, a fragment. 

Either meditation is – and when it is you are wholly in it – or it is not. You cannot make a part of your life meditative.)

Any act can become meditative, and once you know how an act becomes meditative (Kabir would laugh and say, “This weaving is not just weaving. I am making clothes – that is the outer act – but something goes on within me simultaneously that you cannot see. This is my meditation.”

How can a weaver be a meditator through weaving?

If the quality of the mind that you bring to weaving is meditative, then the act is not relevant;it is irrelevant.) you can transform all your acts into meditation. 

TO WANT NOTHING. TO BE NOTHING. TO EXPECT NOTHING

Pleasure is sustained by thought. 

Thought can cultivate the pursuit of pleasure, fear & ambition 

But thought cannot cultivate love. 

You see a beautiful mountain then you say ' I saw a more beautiful mountain two years ago' You aren't really looking at the mountain but @ image in your head. 

Whether you compare people/things/scenery/experience you are always doing the same thing i.e. not seeing the present.

“How can a weaver be a meditator through weaving? If the quality of the mind that you bring to weaving is meditative, then the act is irrelevant.”

Anothersessive, more and more depending, it creates a pattern in which it gets caught, so it cannot look at anything anew, afresh. And so it destroys that very thing, that very perfume of life, which is love.

Obliterate your personal boundaries, if you don't see the world as something outer to yourself and not a part of yourself, then you will always be attacked by uncomfortable feelings opening and talking to others. In agitation your mind gives distorted analysis.

Only individuals exist, society is just words, all_labels are just words.

Ex-writer, IITian, doctor, engineer.

Words can give an insight into what activity a person does but it doesn’t tell who is the doer? Why is he doing this?

In suppression, the mind fights against sensations to protect an illusion(illusion can be once morals or goals or stories one tell themselves.), but you can fight for only so long before weariness overtakes you. 

In expression, you allow yourself to get lost in them, the illusions mind ('Relaxing will help me do my work with more virility'

'This is last time after this I'll work with full vigour and never look back'

'I'll do this last time before i transform'.

Mind may help in suppression too but both are same in the end.

) creates may help in further deepening the immersion

To be with unchanging all the time (In each instant)

Consume change with change, engage in life goal with such intensity that everything else becomes irrelevant, you don’t have time

WHEN HUNGER/DESIRE IS FELT DON’T REBEL  let the pulse come and go

You feel something is negative (shame, etc) and something is enemy  (Water & wind never fight the blade.

Don't call anything enemey nor your friend.

All the problem in controlling desire comes cause we either try to fight against sensation or supress it.

Don't fight with any sensation nor play along with any sensation.

You only feel pain cause you have made yourself sensitive to lot of things, so get rid of all senstivity.

)because you resist, because you are against it,because there is no acceptance of it. 

The enemy exists there because you are protecting yourself against him, because you are not open

Abandon all will. (Don’t do anything. You have tried so many times to stop misery, to stop depression, to stop this and that, and nothing has happened. Now try this: don’t do anything; allow the misery to be there in its totality.

Allow it to happen in its full intensity, and remain non-doing. Just be with it and see what happens.

I have tried so hard, looked everywhere, yet nothing has changed, i am still the same. I suffer about almost the same things.

I think now it’s time for me t o surrender, to give up, there isn’t anything in this world that is in my control.

Everything is futile, even futility is futile cause it doesn’t do anything don’t care where the waves will take me cause my caring is futile, the only thing I can do is RELISH.

RELISH my happiness, relish my misery, my sadness, my loneliness) (WIll to carry out desire, will to play any game, abandon all resistance.)

Whatever destination I reach I will call my destination.      

In order to protect what is temporary, you never reach permanence.

Jealousy isn't seeing a simple fact: you have been taught to see yourself as inferior/superior to someone. 

(When look down satisfaction, when look up ladder 'i am not man enough', worthlessness, meaninglessness.)

()When look down satisfaction, when look up ladder 'i am not man enough', worthlessness, meaninglessness.

If you don't feel superior, you can never feel inferior.

One comes with other. If one of them falls the other falls two. 

Don't judge; everybody is just himself, accpet him as he is. But this is possible only if you accept yourself as you are, with no shame, with no feeling of worthlessness

In college I will go out, talk, fashion, social media a little, try the best I can with my limited karma and just see how things work out. I willn’t lock myself in, I will try to go out to max i can to collect as much karma as I can.  

LIFE COMES DOWN TO OUR 

RELATIONSHIP WITH OURSELVES. 

RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER IS JUST AN SUBSET/ASPECT OF REPLATIONSHIP WITH OURSELVES

Divide between fantasy and reality 

Your mind would like to catch some thought, be identified with it, movewith it, enjoy it, indulge in it. Resist! 

Just happiness will not help,because there will be no challenge. 

Just pain will not help either, 

because there will be nothing to struggle, to hope, to dream; 

There will be no fantasy. 

Both are needed, and life exists between both as a very delicate tension.

This is the way of life – it moves through happiness & suffering and gives you tone, meaning, and depth. So both are good. 

I don’t say choose between the two – I say both are good, don’t choose. Rather, enjoy both; rather, allow both to happen. 

Let no-resistance be your motto: I will not resist life. 

Whatever life gives to me, I will be ready to take and enjoy it. 

Darkness has its own beauty; day has its own beauty. 

Don’t choose, be a witness,and bliss will happen to you. 

(Choicelessness will become bliss. Bliss is not contrary to suffering; bliss is a quality which you can bring to anything whatsoever– even to suffering.)

Bliss is not a dead state

Happiness and suffering just happen on the periphery. 

You will see them happening, you will enjoy them happening, but they will happen around you; they will not happen to you.

Know that you are not the wheel. You are the axis, not the wheel

(There is no need to force the changing periphery to be static. There is no need, and you cannot make it static. It will go on, the wheel will go on.)

Question of choosing between bliss and suffering; deep down it is a question of choosing between choosing and non-choosing.

I am just a log in the river. The river will take me where it will take me, i am inanimate, i control nothing, i shouldn’t waste my thinking and always remember that i am a log in river. Love and Death both are futile. 

I can only BREATHE AND RELISH THE WAVES, surrendering to the river and get dragged with it’s flow.

Choice divides life: something has to be cut and thrown away. 

You cannot choose –the whole life has to be lived. 

There will be moments of happiness and there will be moments of suffering, and both have to be lived; you cannot choose.

Sound and silence, sound and silence – that creates music

(You don’t accept the total. You accept something in it and you deny something, that’s what choice means.

If you become aware of this totality of the opposites and the way that life functions, you don’t choose.

When the guest is at home you enjoy him, when he has gone you enjoy the suffering, the absence, the pain. Enjoy both.

This is the path of wisdom: enjoy both, don’t choose. Whatsoever falls upon you,accept it.

It is your fate, it is how life is, and nothing can be done about it.)

You cannot say,

 “I will live only if I am happy. When I am not happy, I will not live.”

If you deny suffering – then in a subtle way you have chosen it. 

If you have the mind of clinging, 

while it is there you will not be able to enjoy it, 

because you will be constantly afraid that it is going to be lost 

and miss the opportunity.

Friendship - We go together Always

Judgment  - I will drag you with me, instead of going with you and understanding

In college, I will learn to appreciate & enjoy how it’s like to be on ground. Don't be scared of rejection cuz caterpillar obviously look disgusting but when caterpillar transforms to butterfly, they started loving butterfly.

You are still caterpillar YOU AREN’T YET, IN-LINE WITH THE REAL YOU. Obviously it will be difficult for people to see the utility/beauty in you.

WHEN IN CATERPILLAR & BUTTERFLY

(Humans are too bust so obviously they will be they occupied to care from some random nobody, unless you are vibrant enough to pull them in & guide them)

IN BOTH STAGES YOU ARE, WERE AND WILL BE ALWAYS SAME Human, These changes of body is just periphery.

KNOW FOR YOURSELF THAT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL & VALUABLE. 

NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS ON PERIPHERY. 

I thought i may have devloped some form of social anxiety but i was suprisingly okay and good. If not for my shame holding me back, there would be no prolbem, i am not scared or emmbarass to talk to girls. Yes, talking to beautiful girl difficult you feel difficultly where to look. BUT DON'T FEAR. SEARCH ON NET ON WHERE TO LOOK ON FACE so when unconsious don't support oyu, your cultivation and practice will

Felt Inadequate when imagined someone telling me that - ‘You are best in…’ , 

‘Becoz of me they had best…’

Shwetabh Gangwar Size Video made me feel bad hearing the story

Reason: You were told you didn’t have internal worth and you have to do something to become valuable, but the product you evolved into isn’t you, YOU WANT TO BE LOVED, ACCEPTED, CARED, Valued FOR who you really are, so you can gain your worth back, through them

But you having no internal worth is the root cause which is LIE! FICTION!

Therefore the desire that branches off from it is too a lie.

VEDANT BHIYA PRIYAM PHONE PHOTO OF FRIEND IN FAREWELL

IT’S NORMAL FOR MALE - FEMALE FEEL ATTRACTION. IF GIVEN OPPORTUNITY MATE, HAVE WILD FUN, school’s TOO BORING

Only human and don't expect something magical, godly out of normal human beings.

PRAY FOR THEM FOR RELATIONSHIPS (TO BE FUN, WILD, EXCITING, ENJOYABLE)

MONOGAMY HAVEN’T YOU SEEN/UNDERSTOOD WHAT DESTRUCTION POSSESSIVENESS LEAVES IN ITS WAKE. (Ex-Mom suppressed childhood)

You are okay - remember ekta, adiba, iit online gi.., daksh asked if i want .

THIS IS ALL THE MORE REASON FOR ME TO NEVER_EVER BE IN SITUATION WHERE I AM IN SITUATION WHERE I WILL BE FORCED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE CUZZ IF I AM TOO WEAKT HEN IT CAN HAPPEN

—------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS DOESN'T MAKE NAYONE SUPERIOR OR INFERIOR. A CHUZA REMAINS A CHUZA. PIKU WILL BE SPECIAL. YOU TOO HAVE TO BE THE VERY BEST FOR HER.

CHUZA THINKS THEY HAVE BECOME BETTER WHEN IN TTUTH THEY REMAIN THE SAME AT THE CORE. THEY HAVEN’T EVEN BROKEN THE FIRST WALL YET.

THINK OF HOW YOU FEEL SEEING ANDREW TATE? DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL INFERIOR OR INSPIRED. I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT FOR PIKU.

I HAVE TO BE? I WANT PIKU TO BE PROUD.

TO HOLD HER HEAD HIGH.

I DON’T WANT TO GIVE HER NORMAL EXPERIENCE. THAT’S TOO DULL AND BORING.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TILL THEN SHOW THAT IT’S ALL NATURAL CUZ THAT IS WHAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE LIKE AND FILL THEIR FANTASY

In college don’t tell a singlew soul of methods or systems,. 

KEEP everything vague and unclear.

YOUR TALENT IS THAT OF A BLACKSMITH, YOU CAN FORGE LEGENDARY SWORDS. And since noone else have legendary sword, even if they are talented, hardworking swordsman they taste dust while fighting you.

BUT WHAT if THEY ALL HAD LEGENDARY SWORD? You are just blacksmith, YOU CAN’T WIN. They don’t know and will never know the pain, suffering, the mind who created THE TECHNIQUE FOR THIS LEGENDARY SWORD WENT TO.

 THE CAN EASILY CUT YOU DOWN ONCE THEY HAVE LEGENDARY SWORD.

Remember once you stop providing value you fall down.

You don’t have ANY MORAL OBLIGATION to say even a single word.

YOU CAN MAYBE TELL PIKU but only to either lure prey or AFTER YOU HAVE ASCERTAIN THAT SHE IS THE ONE.

Then maybe you can reveal all.

UNDER ALL THE SMILES DON’T FORGET THE EXPLOITATION THAT IS HAPPENING. DON’T JUST THINK WITH SENSES. GO BEYOND THE SEEABLE

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO FORGET PAIN, SUFFERING NOT NEED TO HOLD BACK TEARS is (Look up, eyes wide

Don't speak otherwise you will cry

Then look sidewards, as if you are in deep thought,

Slowly slowly manage to find timing to escape from the sceery somehow0)

Do SOMETHING SO ENGAGING, OCCUPYING, THAT YOU DON’T HAVE  TIME FOR THE PAST. IN 6 months everything will look so distant. YOU HAVE DEVELOPED LOT OF NEURAL PATHWAYS AND YOU HAVE TO LEFT THEM BE FOR TO DISSOLVE. MEDITATION IS SHIT!

—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the story belongs to the world for the world, For me it's just present moment that matter, it's only other humans that bring story into play

Someone real lore is intransmittable, incommunicable so jealousy isn't even real.

Everyone is different ArtPiece, different biology, different chemistry, don’t get single-sighted

(Clarity appeals to reasoning; Perfection appeals to emotions)

WHAT SOLUTION YOU CAME THERE TO TAKE AWAY OR WHAT MADE YOU NOTICE THEM

(Why don’t you ignore the persona/story they are selling and screw the assumptions and conclusions your mind is creating, and only admire what solution you came there to take away or what made you notice them— entertainment, art, intelligence, skills.)

Always remember: 

Assumptions exist where data doesn’t. 

And the only data worth collecting is about the ‘self’, 

and in the direction of what the self wants. 

Lastly, if you have ever told yourself that whatever you have in your life is less, then, my friend, 

(In comparing yourself, you will find all the reasons to be miserable,all the excuses to not take action, and all the wrong reasons to want to take action.)

LESS is a perception that is born only after you compare yourself to someone who has more

In not comparing, you find and focus on what you have at hand and make it better. If somebody has more than you, good for them. You have you, so use your mind and the ability to learn together

You are drowning in sorrow because you have assumed they have something that you don’t, and that something would make you happy.

These assumptions exist & matter only because you aren’t following your DHARMA. What will actually fulfill you & make you feel happy.

I FEEL BAD ABOUT MYSELF WHEN SEEING OTHERS HAPPY 

THAT’S BOGUS! I HAVEN’T EVEN STARTED YET.

I HAVE NEVER WENT ON ADVENTURE WITH FRIENDS ON MOUNTAINS

NEVER TRIED ANY ADVENTURE SPORTS

NEVER WROTE ANY BOOK

NEVER FELT HOW PROGRAMMING JOB WILL FEEL LIKE

NEVER LEARN DRAWING

DIDN’T MADE ANY FRIENDS TO WATCH MOVIES, ANIME, BAKCHODI

I AM JUST SITTING HERE AND PHILOSOPHIZING,  NO NOT EVEN PHILOSOPHIZING BUT JUST LETTING EMOTIONS HOLD MY REINS.

IMAGINATION DON’T HAVE POWER TO MIMIC REALITY FEELING EVEN TO IMISCULE DEGREE 

IMAGINATION JUST CAN'T YOU ARE FOOLING ONLY YOURSELF

Using hide and seek club memory as bridge, bring back the feeling you felt when you climb on top of house roof inside your body

—-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ENJOY ALL COLORS/ DANCE ON EACH TONE IN THE PRESENT

LUCKILY FOR OLD AGRIM THESE PROBLEMS WON’T EXIST OR EVEN REMEBER ALL SOURCE OF AGRIM’S SUFFERING WILL FALL-APART

FOCUS ON USING THAT YOUTHFUL ENERGY & VIRILITY FOR MAKING YOURSELF BLOOM. DON’T LET SEASONAL FLOWERS DISTRACT YOU. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ekta, adiba, online iit online gi.., daksh asked if i want

Somya awesome moment & memories & her commnet - you are perfect but lack public speaking

I have seed for infinite talent, intelligence and adaptation

Self-respect comes from self-control. There is no correlation.

Status must not dictate who the person is or how he should behave! (Don't hide or cower!)

The person must dictate what to do with the status in accordance with how they feel about that status.

SpecialTreatment ISN’T 

AcknowledingYou / GivingYouAttention/Moment of time

Specialness does not require anybody but the individual. 

Why am I special? What have I done in my life?, 

and get a clear answer. In case you feel dissatisfied, 

then you have the option to earn it. 

Nobody gives it to you, you have to take

If you need somebody else to tell you that you are special, then you have not done anything to earn it in your own mind

(You aren’t desperately wanting acceptance by anyone you desire.

If you follow your goal.

The impact the rejections have almost stops mattering to you.

You’re not playing the game of probability anymore.

You have put the priorities of your own life on top.)

Following satisfaction and a meaning will give you strength that 

OTHER’S APPROVAL/ASSURANCE/RESPECT STOP HAVING MUCH SIGNIFICANT VALUE

Would you be happy if you were born as a monkey? Even if you the monkey lived happily your entire life, harem, food, enjoyment, would you want that? Same food, sex pleasure? Would that really make you happy? Refer back to post-nut-clarity. In those times lust seems insignificant, it's only your body who is forcing you to feel that lack. 

DON’T YOU WANT TO GO ON ADVENTURE, TO DISCOVER WHAT LIE BEYOND THE HORIZON? BEAUTY NOONE ELSE HAS SEEN/DISCOVERED.

 Even if you have to fight your sleep, your 

pain/misery/insecurity/lust/NeedForWarmthCare

To go beyond the lust bullshitery.

FIGHT EVEN IF YOU DIE, EVEN AFTER YOU DIE

You have to say, fuck happiness. I don’t want to be happy, I want to be satisfied in life. I want self-satisfaction

Desire comes from LACK. 

CAUSE YOU DON'T LACK ANYTHING, YOU HAVE BEEN MADE TO BELIEVE YOU LACK SOMETHING BUT IN ACTUALITY YOU DON'T

Don't ignore/run-away/chase the lack cause all these will magnify the lack more than it really is.

The only way to shake off these CONDITIONING is to TO SET A GOAL THAT IS SO ENGAGING AND CONSUMING THAT YOU DON’T HAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING.

TIME TO THINK ABOUT REST/SLEEP/EATING. BE SO OBSESSED

I will not WORK ON MATCHING MY TIMELINE & STORYLINE with others. 

I will work for that agrim that is old with a dead wife. 

What would he be proud and happy of?

'When you say the past doesn't matter' you are just running away(Taking & Bending the reality:There is opportunity in every single second to change). PAST DO MATTER. Because the future and present are born from the past.

 It should not be I wanna show them, but I wanna show myself; 

I want to be great so I can be satisfied with myself.

DO FOR THE OLD AGRIM & MEDITATE ON THE UNCHANGING.

Feeling: lonely, ugly, unwanted, a loser, a piece of shit 

Solution: Allow their presence in your mind. It’s okay to feel those things

              Acknowledge your vulnerabilities with respect not fear

             don’t cover them by distraction. LOOK & ACKNOWLEDGE

PAIN needs acceptance and from then on, it starts to subside. 

A lot of your problems originates from fascination 

(comparing, envying, aspiring and  desiring.) 

Don’t waste solutions to problems that don’t even exist. 

We aren't defeated in one decisive battle, we're defeated on tiny seemingly insignificant surrender at a time. 

That chips away at who we really SHOULD BE. 

Don't half-finish things. All small goals & things should be followed through! This following-through stacks up positive karma and provides you buff think of everything as you are doing for buff. 

And if you drop small things everything else will fall too.

If you're attacking you don't get as tired as you'd get when you're chasing.

Nature is a flux. 

Don’t waste your time trying to make it static. 

Just know it as it changes. Be the witness of it.

Your awareness is never a flux..

Your whole life has been a flux; nothing remained the same for even two moments.

Suffering comes, you witness it. Then happiness comes, you witness it. Then nothing comes, you witness it. Only one thing remains constant –witnessing – and witnessing is you

Even the ego you identify yourself with is ever-changing.

Prayer is a love relationship – not between two individuals, 

but between one individual and existence itself. 

It is not that one person needs you. It is coming to understand, to realize that you are not different from this existence which looks so indifferent.

You are part of it, organically one with it. And if a tree is flowering, it is not separate from you. You have flowered in the tree and the tree has become conscious in you

Wherever satisfaction is found, in whatever act, actualize this.

You feel thirsty, so you drink water.

You see a friend and you feel happy;you meet your lover or beloved and you feel happy: actualize this.

A subtle satisfaction is attained. Forget the water, forget the thirst. Remain with the subtle satisfaction that you are feeling. 

Be filled with it; simply feel satisfied.

You carry your own hell and heaven with you,and both of them are burdens.

Bliss and misery are our interpretations.

Why choose satisfaction cuz? Why not non choosing

from hell to heaven, from heaven to beyond.

Misery cannot be renounced. It is difficult; you cling to it. Only happiness can be renounced

To talk to the negative mind about choicelessness, about going beyond duality, about living both negative and positive, is meaningless. Not that this is untrue – it is true, but meaningless.

With happiness you get bored. You can move into the unknown. The unknown is alluring, and the choiceless is the door for the unknown

Remember, and analyze your own life. 

Have you ever taken account of happy moments, of contents, of satisfactions, of blissful glimpses? 

You have not taken any account, but you have taken every account of your pain, suffering, misery, and you go on accumulating. self-perpetuating cycle

You are an accumulated hell, by your own choice.

If you become identified with pain, you're looking from a window, and the window of pain, of suffering, opens only towards hell. 

If you are one with a satisfactory moment, a blissful moment, an  ecstatic moment, you’re opening another window.  

The existence is the same, but your windows are different.

He was miserable in a hut; now he will be miserable in a palace.This misery may be palatial, but he will be miserable

Only one change, only one revolution, only one mutation can be there, and that is if your mind changes from negative to the positive. 

You will be filled with a new sweetness and fragrance. Just look for the beautiful; forget the ugly. Then a moment comes when the ugly also becomes the beautiful.

Buddha said, “Then I will ask you three questions before I allow you to go. If the people of that province insult you, humiliate you, how will you feel?”

Purnakashyapa said, “I will feel they are very good if they simply insult me. Then they are not beating me. They are good people; they could have beaten me.”

Buddha said, “Then the second question: if they start beating you, how will you feel?”

Purnakashyapa said, “I will feel they are very good people. They could have killed me, but they are simply beating me.”

Then Buddha said, “Now the third question: if they really murder you, then at the moment when you are dying how will you feel?”

Purnakashyapa said, “I will thank you and them. If they kill me, they will have freed me of a life where many errors were possible.

They will have freed me so I will feel thankful.”

So Buddha said, “Now you can go anywhere. The whole world is heaven for you. Now there is no problem. The world is a heaven, so you can go anywhere.”

In moods of extreme desire, be undisturbed.

The desire pulls you somewhere into the future; the past provides extra push to thrust you into the future.

Stay in the center there is no cyclone, and a cyclone cannot exist without a silent center.

The disturbance is there, and yet the disturbance is not.

Witnessing is neither; suppressing nor expressing. It is not expressing because you are not expressing it to the object/image of desire. It is not being suppressed either. You are allowing it to be expressed – expressed in a vacuum. 

Meditate on it.

(You can also focus on one sound/object/GoalPursuit or just the unmoving inside) 

When you become disturbed, cuz you forget everything even to meditate

Once you know the secret you can consume anything through itself, but the secret is to be silent without doing anything. 

MISERY is there, so be, just BE. Don’t do anything, feel it. 

Don’t analyze misery and try to fight or change it

If your consciousness is directed towards changing the misery . 

Then you are missing a very beautiful experience – the misery itself.

You’re consuming misery through misery

If you can do this much, this “non-doing,” if you can just be there – present, witnessing, but making no effort to change anything – allowing things to have their own way,

you will consume anything. You can consume anything.

Efforts of mind on contemplation of misery is either to

-Get rid of misery

-To feel more miserable.

CHOOSE NOTHING, DON'T USE INTELLECT CAUSE CURRENTLY MISERY IS THE ONE WHO POSSESS THE INTELLECT. FIGHTING WITH RIVER FLOW WON'T HELP. 

YOU WILL ONLY WEAR YOURSELF OUT.

Efforts of mind on contemplation of misery is either to

“Get rid of misery” or “To feel more miserable”.

DON'T USE MISERY POSSESED INTELLECT TO FIGHT MISERY.

PATIENT TRYING TO DO SURGERY ON HIMSELF IS MANIACAL. 

If there is attachment don’t fight with it. Be attached, but be a witness (Life is a shadow because change is nothing but a shadow. The unchanging is the real; the changing is the unreal.)  also.

Problems are created not by the changing periphery. They are created by the identification that “I am this change.”

) You have fallen ill; illness isnot really the disturbance.

When you feel that “I have fallen ill,” it is adisturbance. If you can be a witness to that illness, if you can feel that illness is a happening somewhere on the periphery – that it is not

happening to you, it is happening to someone else and you are just thewitness – then death also can happen and you will be just a witness.

2)It is not a disturbance at all. It becomes a disturbance only if you cling to it or if you try to make it unmoving

be aware of the center which is unmoving, and allow the whole existence to move

Just become aware of it. That very awareness isenough to liberate you. That very feeling that “I am unmoving” liberates.That is the truth. You know it, and you are different

Don’t fight with shadows! And the whole.

3) The sannyasin laughed and said, “You came a little late. You cannot killme now because I have killed myself already. You are a little late. You can

cut my head, but you cannot cut me because I have become a witness. . Sowhen this head will fall down on the earth, you will see it falling downand I will also see it falling down. But you cannot cut me; you cannoteven touch me. So don’t waste time, you can cut! Raise your sword andcut my head.”

Alexander couldn’t kill that man. It was impossible because it wasuseless. The man was so beyond death, it was impossible to kill him. Youcan only be killed if you cling to life. That clinging to the changing patternmakes you a mortal. If you don’t cling, you are as you have always been –immortal. Immortality is your birthright; it has always been there. You become a mortal only if you cling

Wherever you go the change will be there. 

All escape is futile, so don't try to escape. 

Then what to do? Don’t cling. 

Live the change, be the change. Don’t create any struggle, move with it.  The river is flowing; you flow with it. 

Don’t even swim; allow the river to take you. 

Don’t fight with it, don’t waste your energy by fighting with it; 

just relax. Be in a let-go and move with the river

In fighting you may forget this. That is why Tantra says, 

Through Change consume change. Don’t fight. 

There is no need because in you the change cannot enter. 

Live in the world. Don’t be afraid because in you the world cannot enter.

Live it. Don’t choose this way or that.

There  are two types of people: 

one that will cling to the world of change and one that will escape. 

Tantra says it is change, so to cling is futile and to escape also. 

What is the use? Buddha says, “What is the use of remaining in the world of change?” Tantra says, “What is the use of escaping from it?”

Both are futile. Rather, allow it to happen. You are not concerned with it; it is happening, you are not even needed for it. 

You were not and the world was changing, and you will not be and the world will go on changing – so why create any fuss about it?

There is no need to change anyone – neither the world nor yourself. 

You are just to know that everything is changing, and to float in the change and relax in the change.

When lust attacks me then always my mind starts saying this is SPECIAL ONE. (-Like you are finally alone in empty house

-This is a special category of material that you haven’t watched for so long.

-FIRST TIME being in situation something like this

-Today is LAST TIME, situation is going to change from tomorrow on

-Today you can make this an exception) 

This is becoz I haven’t fully given up HAPPINESS-CHASING.

THESE ARE SHARDS OF MY WEAKNESS LEFT THAT I HAVE TO PUSH AWAY

WHY I CAVE INTO SENSUAL PLEASURE?

IS THE PRESENT MOMENT SO WORTHLESS THAT A REPETING SAME ACT MASTURBATION IS ONLY GOOD?

SEEING THE PATH I AM THREADING AS BIG THING AND ONLY END MATTERS

 REALLY IS LUST EXPRESSION BEST WAY TO DO SHUBHARAMBH?  

WHEN I CAN DO MY MUCH AWAITED

DRAWING (FL1 SUN DRAW)

NOVEL READ (ZERO BELIEVER GODDESS CHAPTER

                         MOB ISEKAI NEW VOLUME

                         AGAINST THE GODS)

MEDITATION 

(SEEING THE TINY BIT DISAPPOINTMENT AND              LOOKING AT IT UNTIL IT DISSIPATES/ NOT LETITNG DISAPPOINTMENT/FRUSTRATION/SpecialTime

Affect me by fully accepting no fight no resist, not even thought off destroy

JUST EXPLORING FEELING)

DON’T RUN AWAY INTO HENTAI TO ESCAPE AND THROW OUT AN UNDESIRABLE FEELING. FACE IT, HEAD ON! 

WHY DID I LOSE MY REAL VALUES & DREAMS FOR THE SAKE SHALLOW DOMINANCE HIERARCHY 

GAINING MORE POWER, RESPECT, ATTENTION

I HAVE WASTED SO MUCH TIME IN MASTURBATION

If I have invested same time in

Connoisseur in NOVELS instead of amateur

   2) God Level Drawing 

       (FantasyLandscape, Dragons, Silvia Moon, Extreme Fights,             

        Portraits Humans/Animals/Scenery Realistic & stylized)

   3) Quasi-God Writing Level (Novels, one-shot, poetry)

   4) Analysis Novels God

   5) Gigguk, The Anime Man level mastery in Anime

   6) Chinese & Japanese Both Decent Level

All of the above would have contributed me living more meaningful & happy life

IT HAS BEEN ONE OF MY PILLAR OF DESTRUCTION THAT PERPETUATED ALL THE -VE IN MY LIFE.

5th class 2015 began iit through olympiad, till now 7.5yrs passed whose all culmination which could have led me to godhood, i have WASTED!

YOUR EMOTIONS, TEMPORAL FEELINGS ARE LIAR

I HAVE SPENT LAST 6yrs suffering for things, which were outside me. 

To get approval, respect, happiness, to blend WHAT HAPPENED? ONLY DESTRUCTION & REGRET.

Give up happiness chasing 

Chase only the meaningful goal!

DON’T MAKE IT THAT YOU GIVE UP ON

ENJOYING BREEZE, THE SCENERY, THE BEAUTY

Choose life & meaning over PLEASURE & happiness

It's a lie and bullshit that humans are meant to not use their drive, set goals, we are meant to break through and overcome ( I'll prove it to myself. I will carve a path of beauty for me, not happiness/content/satisfaction/suffering/RelaxChill but beauty. Beauty is the virtue I will follow.)

'I don't do XYZ' is a powerful sentence. It's not like I can't but I just don't. I don't cheat. (CHANGE IT INTO HINDI AND WITH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOU USE - I don't eat in asymmetrical utensil) 

( (Voice in head screams FREEDOM FREEDOM so try to think and come through conclusion for that.====  I don't want peace/content/stagnation i want beauty, anything bland willn't do.  SAY THEM IN HINDI WITH DEEP FEELING TIE YOUR IDENTITY WITH IT, THINK ABOUT IT WHOLE DAY.

PROMISE TO FL1. Daily Repeat to FL1 on 3hr. Say these commandment in arrogant huff to future humans you meet 

)

THE LOST VALUES

VideoGameDevPassion was disguise for real fantasy love i crave. ResidentEvil, World War Z how beautiful

Saransh,Arpan,Devrath talk about zombie apocalypse beauty

RESPONSIBILITY

I WANT TO GIVE BACK MY MOTHER HAPPINESS FOR ALL THE SUFFERING SHE HAD TO ENDURE TILL NOW.

I WANT TO AFFORD HER TREATMENT IN FOREIGN COUNTRY.

I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. I WAS RUNNING AWAY BY CALLING IT BURDEN AND CALLING IT BORING. 

All to make up for the resonance of suffering from mom in me from mom, I have lived my whole life till now for others, but now it's for myself, not for family! FOR MY family (my=mine part, under my wing)

Mother luxurious & tension free life

Make mom read my novel

GoalNow- Infinite Agility (Do everything fastly, more faster than humanly possible, even the smallest thing, I HAVE BENDED MYSELF for the body for long time It's  TIME FOR BODY TO ADAPT, TO BEND, TO GROW BEYOND FOR ME)

         Ultimate WillPower (Even osho said will and desire different, will is beautiful because it helps the seed to grow into the grandest tree)

Psychology (peers, media, movies) rides on hardwiring of body (pleasure, continuation, etc)

I will stand still & strong. It's battle worth fighting and worth winning. If i win this battle, then the rest of war is already won.If i can drop this habit that has plagued me ever since I was 10yrs old.

Yes body will overwhelm me again and again like it has done till now BUT I WILL SHOW FULL RESISTANCE,  I willn't fall this time.

No matter how meaningless, miserable, pathetic, hollow, guilt, bored, tired, unexcited etc whatever i feel I willn't run away and loose.

I want to be proud of myself, at least one time in my eyes.

That's the greatest joy you're ever going to experience in life is being truly and uniquely yourself

That glorious adaptation response that makes humans the apex predator 

EAT,COPOPULATE,SLEEP REPEAT CAN ONLY WORK FOR ANIMALS.           

FOR HUMANS IT HAS TO BE PURSUIT OF BEAUTY

SLEEP WITH GOALS FUTURE & THINGS YOU'll LIVE NEXT DAY IN MIND, JUST DON'T SAY IT'S ANOTHER MONOTONE REPETITION DAY! NO! I WILL WORK, BREAK AWAY ALL LIMITS! ALL WEAKNESS THAT MY BODY HAS ACCUMULATED, I'll SHED EVERYTHING! BODY WILL AUTOMATICALLY NEED LESS SLEEP & GET BETTER SLEEP.

(I KNOW IT'S PAINFUL TO DO THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR BODY WORK BEST, YOU'll have TO PUSH PUSH PUSH THE LIMITS, GO BEYOND HORIZON.

FORGET SLEEP WHILE YOU'R AWAKE! IF BODY FEELS SLEEP SAY FUCK YOU AND PUSH BODY WILL AUTOMATICALLY BEND AND ADPAT FOR YOU.)

CHOOSE

Settle for someone lesser because of pressure 

OR 

Being a high vantage point with many choice and then choosing the lesser one option

I WILL CHOOSE 2nd Option

NOTHING IN MY LIFE WILL EVER GO WRONG AS WRONG AS I DON’T LIE TO MYSELF.

I think on firdt layer of me is that weak vulnerable energy, if i gicve in it's easily possible for it to possess me, but i can also just cloth it around of me, it will ruyb on me little, but i can't be damaged.. TO STOP YOURSELF FROM LAUGHINF REMEMBER this feeling of weakness, vulnerable, shame, RECALL HOW ALL OF THIS IS LIE, SHAM,UTILITY

When the shower comes, be thankful, don't make it normal, visit the dark at least a little from time to time, so that you don't forget, WHAT'S original reality, and what is the shower. THE ONLY REGRET NOW I'LL HAVE IS THAT WHEN I GET SHOWERS, I WILL ACCEPT THEM AS NORMAL AND NOT VALUE IT. 

it's only luck that was given karma and circumstances to allow those experiences.

PLEASE DON’T follow the cheap pursuit of being happy all time.

The only reason in 8th class, I was able to enjoy things to this extent was because I was fish who saw a river for the first time.

All those fish who were in river ever since they were born will never be able to appreciate the beauty of river,

EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE THE CLOSEST.

The -ve in a sense given you an extra-dimensional appreciation

DOn't reveal your secrets, the gifts that make \s you specail to others. LOok at suyash, he has done what took you so so so long and still not at decent level in no time. YOU DON'T HAVE INNATE GOD INTELLIGENENCE AND your discovery intution is onyl good at discovery not at competition and you will onl\y win in competition or have value as long as you know/ discover something that others haven't seen. 

You’re just extremely lucky to stumble on so many resource in right harmonious order.

People Engage In Give Take (not good/bad implication) but only for utility and your utility best will be there by having unknown element otherwise they may respect less

THE FIGHT BETWEEN MY INTUITIVE WILL and my MIND-BODY.

I AM OUTCLASSED.  BUT I STILL HAVE A SMALL HOPE OF SUCCESS, NO NOT IN REAL WORLD BUT IN THIS FIGHT FOR BLOOMING

In the end i will have to blow the air on my hands to warm them up. 

The only person that can get me out is ME! 

 THE CONTINUOUS STRUGGLE FOR BLOOMING AND NOT LETTING THE GARDEN BURN TO DUST WILL CONTINUE AND WOULD NEVER STOP.

IT IS A FIGHT THAT I CAN'T WIN. I CAN NEVER WIN. EVEN SO I HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS

ISN’T EXISTENCE BEING A GIFT JUST A SUBJECTIVE REALITY, 

ONLY THE PERSON WHO WAS GIFTED SEE AS, 

PERSON WHO LIVES IN HELL WILL SEE IT AS CURSE,

BOTH ARE DELUSIONED. I GUESS?

THIS WORLD IS DELUSION.

THIS FIGHT TOO MAYBE DELUSIONAL FROM OMNISCIENT PERSPECTIVE BUT FOR ME IT’S VERY MUCH REAL

BEING ABLE TO FIGHT THIS WORTHY FIGHT IS A GIFT or MAYBE CURSE.

BUT NO OTHER CHALLENGE OR FIGHT IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE TO DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF THIS FIGHT.

THIS IS A FIGHT BEYOND ALL FIGHTS.

THIS IS JUST A ONE SIDED FIGHT. OPPONENT DON’T EVEN RECOGNISE ME AS OPPONENT, FOR HIM I DON”T EVEN MATTER, HE WILL DECIDE RANDOMLY WITH NO EMOTION WHEN HE WOULD LET ME WIN AND WHEN HE DEFEATS ME.

Do waht your duty is to do, no matter what your mood is

More so than a perfect flower, A flower that strives to bloom is even more beautiful!

HAVE I LOST MY BEAUTIFUL CHILDHOOD? 

BUT NOW THINKING BACK DID I EVER HAD SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL?

I THINK I HAVE SUFFERED AND EXPERIENCE SO MUCH PAIN, LONELINESS, HURT, TRAUMA IN CHILDHOOD TOO

IT WASN’T BED OF ROSES. 

MAYBE THERE WERE FEW PHASES WHERE I FELT LIKE I WAS FLOATING

ASIDE FROM THAT 

ASSA NHI THA UN PHASE MAI BHI SADNESS NHI THI PR USS SAMAY WO WORTH IT THA

world was just bland normal.

I was just in place where happiness was able to bloom in me, and i was able to live forgetting all the -ve and problem. ACTUALLY NO! I couldn’t even forget the problem.

BUT I HAD FEW LIES & ILLUSION THAT CONTAINED ME, THOSE STRUCTURE PROVIDED ME BIT OF PROTECTION BUT THEY WEREN’T ABLE TO REALLY PROTECT ME. I RECIVED A GOOD AMOUT OF DAMAGE AND HURT EVEN AFTER THAT. BECAUSE ALL OF THEM WAS LIE. THE THINGS THAT WERE PROTECTING ME WERE IN REALITY ACTUALLY HURTING AND TORTURING ME.

Question about meaning? point in trying are born out of -ve mood and not out of real curiouosity. OTHERWISE why don those question bother you in MOMENT YOU ARE FEELING MOST MENAINGGUL AND HAPPY, a leg injury will hurt equally in happy or sad mood then why not this? why does it disapper and repear randomly

You thought you were the only one who is alone, everyone has someone that fully understands them but REALLY? Is that statement really the truth?

If you were born in body of one of your friends would have gotten someone else who fulls gets you. Actually someone who will gets you is an illusion.

Reality-We can only understand each other as much as we are capable of understanding

AND IF FIGHT DON’T EXIST THEN HE SHOULD HAVE POWER TO GRANT ME WHAT TO CRAVE FOR RIGHT THIS INSTANT AND IF NOT THEN CONFLICT EXIST.

dude just chill out relax why are you so crazy right all that stuff drives the quitting mind.

WORK TO MAKE OBSESSION YOUR NEW NORMAL. WORKING DAY AND NIGHT AS NEW NORMAL. 

MIND WILL SAY - I am tired, I deserve reserve, i deserve some rest.

DON’T LISTEN. DON’T BEND. 

LET THE BODY ADAPT AND FORM HABIT FOR YOU.

Do Action without any will.

If you want to, try to reason and logic your way out of the an inertial state.

INTENSE LUST, SLEEPINESS, ETC 

You will suffer pointlessly and you will win sometimes and you will lose sometimes.

SO TO BREAK THE CYCLE

DON’T THINK, JUST ACT WITHOUT THINKING AND APPLY TEMPORAL FREEZE ON LOGIC AND REASON WITHOUT ANY MOTIVATION JUST PURE ACTION WITHOUT THOUGHT.

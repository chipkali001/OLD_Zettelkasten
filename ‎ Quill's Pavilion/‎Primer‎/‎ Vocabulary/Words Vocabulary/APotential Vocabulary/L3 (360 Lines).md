 330. She had not liked him even yesterday when he had said in his impulsive way, “Anyway, let me tell you that my name is Tom.” She had only bowed her little distant bow. She saw hurt in his eyes but she did not wish to assuage it. Indeed, he was a great trouble in this house.

6. Samantha jolted awake at the sound of breaking glass. She sat up, heart racing, and listened for any other sounds. When none came, she reached for the lamp on her nightstand, but her hand met only empty air. "What was that?" she whispered, her voice shaking. At the sound of her voice, the floorboards creaked outside her bedroom door. She froze, listening, as the footsteps approached. When the door handle turned, she braced herself for the worst. But it was only her husband, Dave, looking wild-eyed and disheveled. "Dave, what's going on?" she asked. He shook his head, grabbing her arm. "We have to go," he said, his voice urgent. Samantha tried to pull away, but he held on tight. "What do you mean? What's happening?" "Don't go," he said, his grip tightening. "Don't go!" His fear was contagious, and Samantha felt her own rising. They stood there, frozen, as the footsteps outside grew closer and closer. Finally, when the sound was nearly upon them, they crept back into bed together, holding each other tight.
7. The wind howled through the broken window, sending shivers down Jill's spine. She clutched her blanket tightly, trying to ignore the sound of footsteps outside her door. But when the doorknob turned, she knew she was in trouble. "Who's there?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the wind. There was no answer, only the sound of breathing. She could feel the presence in the darkness, lurking just beyond the threshold. "Don't go," she pleaded, but her voice was drowned out by the sound of the wind. The footsteps drew closer, and she squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the worst. But the presence stopped just outside her door, and then retreated into the night. Jill let out a breath she didn't know she was holding, and hugged her blanket even tighter.

140. His eyes are on the same level as your own. His nose is freckled and turns upwards slightly, and when he smiles he does so shyly, exposing teeth. His eyes are green, and when he looks straight at you they seem to shimmer. They seem gentle, almost afraid. Like a gazelle’s. And you look away. You let his eyes run over you a little.
141. And then you come back to find them, slightly breathless

# Ravana
There was a time where vedant bhiya and me made a drawing copy in village and we promised we will draw in it again but next time maybe it got lost. I dony remeber.

We burned ravana in village along with vedant bhiy. After that i carried that bug to backet and we made ravaan 1-2-3 times maybe i don't remeber exactly. Big kids used to make those gigantic ravan but we were kids so we made small ravan. By wasting hell lot of glow covering ravan face (box) with white papers so we can paint ( technique learned from a tv channel)(art attack maybe i dktn remember) but i remeber in tv art channel used to come and i would be excited every time to see it.Â 

Calling vedant bhiya riruru (maybe from doreman), i was Bluetooth.

We one time also had craze for collecting metal car, oh yes hotwells. I had one that was made in Malaysia and i felt it so amazing so i will boost about that special car.

My best cars were a green one heavy car and a red Ferrari type one.

There was a race track set where there were spiral ramps. You put car in there clck some button and car speeds up with super speed.

I feel nobility attached to personality based judging & not on money/look/etc are as shallow as all. Cause it too is biologically determined & other factors which user have no access over.
Its like saying i dont judge womenâ€™s beauty on how their natural beauty BUT how they look with makeup.
IN END everyone is trying to extract something & some humans just love extrating entertainment/drama for personality more.
I think i will place the highest emphasis on values

In 8th class there was a girl named Anshu, her nose was compressed and her jaw was misaligned (so when she used to speak it was little weird sounding)

Almost all the boys in our class used to bully her. In those times, I didn't even know what the term bullying even meant and used to think of it as a completely normal thing to poke fun at classmates but with her they all exceeded the limits. 

They practised untouchability with her.

Like One time during a period I went up to pick up my copy from the teacher's desk, and when I arrived at my seat. Few of my friends started doing ‘eww’ (disgust face) and said that Anshu touched your copy and now you're touching. They will place a finger on their nose to look like her (her nose was compressed) and then will like to mimic and worse exaggerate how she speaks by noises (her jaw was misaligned).

I now regret that, Even though I felt bad. I tried talking to my friends you shouldn’t do that but i was not really proficient with my language, words and conveying myself.

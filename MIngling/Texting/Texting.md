I was scouring through my youtube feed and just stumbled upon this

1. What’s your “go to” video or gif for a laugh?

A great way to get a good laugh and have something common to talk about, both now and in the future. Plus you get to see how much their sense of humor matches yours. And if you’ve got some great funny videos tucked away, you can share some of them.

2. Where’s your favorite place to get take away or delivery from?

If you know the place and like it, you can talk about how good it is. If you don’t know it, give it a shot and you’ll have something to talk about next time you text them!

3. What song do you play most often?

Great for getting to know their musical taste and seeing how well it matches up with your own. Plus everyone is passionate about the music they love and chances are they will be more than happy to talk a lot about it.

4. What’s your favorite quote from a movie?

A question that begs for back and forth movie quotes from their and your favorite movies. Plus it’s really easy to branch off and start talking about what movies they like.

5. What’s your “go to” joke?

Everyone loves to laugh, and everyone has at least one joke they know by heart. And you’ll also be able to tell them a few jokes as well. If you are like me and can’t remember many jokes, try the [jokes subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jokes). Just sort by top / month or week.

6. What song has the best intro?

Another question that works well on a phone because after they let you know you can look it up on your phone and have a listen. Then come back and tell them what you thought about it.

7. What is the scariest non banned item you could take on to a plane?

This is more of a creative one. But great for some back and fourth as you both think of scary non banned items. (e.g. parachute, voodoo doll in pilot uniform, full clown outfit, etc.)

8. What’s the (funniest / most disappointing / weirdest / etc.) text you’ve gotten?

This one probably isn’t a good one to lead with, but it’s great after you’ve texted for a bit and need something else to talk about.

9. What is your favorite meme?

Everyone has at least one meme that they really like. You can find out their’s, who know’s maybe it’s the same as yours! Also a great way to get a conversation going solely through memes which is always fun.

10. How many questions can you answer in just pictures?

This one is more of a game really. You ask general, generic questions and they try to answer only through images. Quite fun if they are up to it. It’s like a treasure hunt. But I probably wouldn’t lead with this one, good for later and if they are in a playful mood.

11. What is the most interesting thing you have on you or near you right now? Send me a pic of it.

A unique way to find a new topic to talk about. And you’ll also get an idea of what kinds of things they find interesting.

12. What app on your phone do you think I should get?

This kind of depends on how into apps they are. But everyone has two or three apps that they can’t live without. If you’ve got the one they suggest, then you can talk about what you think about it. If you don’t, well now you’ve got a new app you can check out.

13. What’s the best photo you’ve taken?

Time to give them the chance to show off. We’ve all got pictures that we’ve taken that we really like. Now you get to compliment them on their pride and joy. Definitely a solid question to ask a girl or guy over text.

14. What’s the worst text that you accidentally sent?

Embarrassment is a powerful emotion and if they’ve got a story they are willing to share then that will bring you both a little closer. It’s great to empathize with them and if it isn’t too bad you can do some good natured teasing.

15. What thing do you really wish you could buy right now?

Great because they can send you a link to the product they want and you can check it out. Now you’ve got something to talk about that they are really into.

16. What’s the funniest thing that someone could spend money on / buy on the internet?

Similar to the above question because they can send you the link, but this one takes a little more creativity. Often this one leads to a hilarious stream of funny products and services.

17. What’s the funniest picture you have on your phone?

Similar to earlier video question, and great for the same reason. It gives you something you can both talk about. You could also narrow it down and say the funniest picture of you on your phone.

18. What dumb pickup lines do you know?

Everyone knows some dumb / funny pickup lines. And this question is a great way to get a good back and forth of funny pickup lines going.

19. What are some unwritten rules?

This one is a little bit different than the rest. You could take it in a couple of directions, like unwritten rules between friends or you could go with society at large.

But like many of the other questions to ask a boy or girl over text, it’s great because it’s perfect for back and forth texting as you both think of new rules.

20. What happens in real life but rarely gets portrayed in movies?

Here is another one that might take a little bit of creativity. You can also easily flip it around and ask what happens in movies all the time but rarely happens in real life.

21. What isn’t real but you desperately wish it was?

This one is just fun to answer. Everyone likes to fantasize about the amazing stuff they wish existed.

22. What’s the best “hidden gem” that you’ve found?

Who doesn’t like sharing cool stuff they found? It can be a band, a website, something they bought, really anything. You can let them know it doesn’t have to be really unknown. It can be just something they stumbled across.

23. What’s the silliest thing you are passionate about?

We’ve all got our passions that are less than productive, they keep us sane. And this is a great way to see what they are really into. Something that they might not let everyone know about.

24. What do you hate / love most about your phone?

I’m sure you have a love / hate relationship with your phone, and they probably do too. It can be a general thing like it takes up too much of my time, or a specific feature like the fingerprint scanner.

25. What’s the most ridiculous thing you’ve seen online recently?

This one is another one that will give you both something common to talk about. And it’s easy for them to send you a link to the ridiculous thing so you can check it out.

So that’s it! I hope you’ve enjoyed this list of questions to ask a guy or girl over text. Hopefully you found at least a few questions that will work for you.

If you need even more questions, we’ve got more than a few to offer. Here are just a few others you can check out!

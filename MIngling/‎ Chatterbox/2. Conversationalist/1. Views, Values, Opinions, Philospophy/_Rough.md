At first I thought it would be nice to go in same school for whole growing up, but now I think going to different school showed me different shades.

Some are more vibrant and some are darker

Myabe all this wasn't so bad. Few years ago in my lowesrt i woukldn't have imagine my lfie would be like this ever. Just remembering that fills me with so much joy and pride. WIthout extreme starvation, You can never enjoy the taste fuyllest. I just remeber OSHO's story, that an fish realize that it was in river once she is finally pulled out SHE REAKLISE SHWE WAS IN RIVER but it's too late now/  no matter how much she struggles, cries, bleeds, tear herself.

YES I HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY SCARED BUT IT’S JUST A SCAR.

JUST A SCAR. NAD ISAN’T IT GOOD CUZ IF IT VANISHES WITHOUT TRACES THEN WHAT WILL ALL THAT MISERY AMOUNT TO. IF it were ll to disappear.

I CAN BE CONSTANTLY AND INFINITELY GRATEFUL AFTER SEEING MY SCARS AND PRESENT SCENARIO.

My Leanring Technique For PCM, Competitive Programming - Repeat 7-8x OBJECTIVE ISN'T ROTE MEMORIZATION.  Objective is to increase prominence of whatever you methods you used. 

YOu may have heard people say - “To be good in Maths practice is key”

I think it’s not precise

For solving the problems we will encounter, we need to use our innate PATTERN DETECTION ABILITY, one way you can acheive through practice, BUT PRACTICE AGAIN you are just increasing prominence by spending effort, YOU WILL REMEMBER A THING IF you spent more effort time into it.

But YOU DON’T NEED WASTE TOO MUCH EFFORT.

YOU CAN DO LOTS AND LOTS OF STEALING TRICKS AND VERY LITTLE PRACTICE AND GET BY JUST FINE.

Bain will automatically extrapolate and apply it without efforts if you did it right. SOemone with no prior provblem solkving expe5rience should mayvbe gather mnore experienc e first and use this cleanly i.e. revisoon., NOT DIRTY STEAL WHERE NO PRACTICE JUST STEAL

I UNDERSTAND, MY CHILDHOOD HAS MADE ME UNDERSTAND, the friendship were there cuz

Situations forced us to stay, so we play roles

Mutual Exploitation, (MAX YOU CAN EXPLOIT IN WHATEVER CONDITION YOU ARE FORCED TO STAY TOGETHER IN)

WHO ARE THERE FOR REAL HEART

The only real perosn, i will draw is piku. For practice i may use image or stranger on net but it's only for hand memory and practice NO EMOTIONS.

My first real human drawing will be piku.

To others say- it's goes against my philosophy to draw real life humans, I did draw for practice but it was practice only.  I eill not use my developed abilities for real humams

DON’T TELL ANYONE, THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HOLED UP IN YOUR ROOM FOR 4-5Years. No there is no need for you to explain anything for anyone.

THEY SIMPLY DON’T DESERVE IT!

Also they will value and make you up in mind less, if you reveal you have been working so desperately hard, make it look NATURAL, FLAWLESS, GODLY, MIRACULOUS, not work of effort.

The fact that free me from fear of others was.

“Everyone is just a human, experiencing and interpreting the world”

"No one can see me, i am always hidden, hidden behind the words, actions, expressions " 

Just like if i wave my SD-Card at you, i don’t fear what files will you see, cuz you can’t see it.

Only i can see myself and that’s a problem too itself. I can’t run away from myself.

Sometimes you will have to make an decision. Choose an side an act. That was the problem that happened on first day of JPM. 

YOU HID TOTALLY. You remained INDECISIVE. Instead of ACTING.

YOU CAN’T ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO CONTROL. THE RIGHT BUTTONS TO PUSH.

It’s okay sometimes you’ll be defeated BUT YOU CAN USE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY, to find a NEW TACTIC THAT YOU DIDN’T KNEW EXISTED IN MY PLAYBOOK.

WHEN YOU ODN’T KNOW WHAT MOVE TO MAKE. JUST FLIP THE SWITCH

Oh poor me~

2017-7th class

As a child i was really sincere and used to play and do everything with my full sincerity but mostly my sincerity lead to disappointment.

Maybe as a result of being hurt again and again. I stopped using my heart, my sincerity, cuz my heart isn't suitable for the world, it will be taken advantage of, i don't have anything i can fully devote it to. 

I HAVE UNDERSTOOD, I HAVE NO STRENGTH NOR ANY WEAKNESS. I AM JUST A SLAVE

I can procastinate anxiety easily.

I want devotion and sincerity the only quality.

Maybe if something in past you don't want to tell it's okay but please talk to me about everything we willnt hide things form each other. 

I want us to be closer than best friends.

GHow od you love someone? I never know anyone fully. All we have is image of them, anda ll the show is cullmination of past karma done to/by them/world. Unless we fighure out and define WHO AMI I? how can we love an other I? Is it just compassion or a biological phenomenon

I hate pretension, people only spewing out things out of habits, i love spontaneity, but spontainity is luxury only those in power can afford, if everything is prearranged it becomes repulsive

My internal values are primitive.

I will not except my women taking to a bunch of dudes cause i have never ever seen that behaviour growing up. Never will I accept bestfriends.

It's final judgement, there is no space for negotiation.

I must have told you lot of times 

I am very territorial person

"Didn't you for a single second thought that i willn't like this. Did the thought never cross your mind even for a second?

Were you just completely oblivious and thought that i will be like - 'oh are best friend hi to hai'

In the very beginning and constantly i have asked 

Just be sincere to me. I will conquer the whole world for you if you wish so. Just be sincere.

I am not here to entertain.

There is no space or accoromation for this thing. This on same league or even beyond cheating.

DON'T BE A SISSY, breakup

And ask her

"Didn't you for a single second thought that i willn't like this. Did the thought never cross your mind even for a second?

Were you just completely oblivious and thought that i will be like - 'oh are best friend hi to hai'

I want you to be happy and enjoy BUT this is like 

It's cannibalism. 

If we are left starving on island, you can't just chop my legs off and eat them and then say do you wanted me to starve? 

I just asked you for your sincerity.

I am more than ready to accommodate lot of habits behavior but this is something i hate and despise. 

Don't be possessive, territorial is bad. 

In my eyes you are hypocrite

Oh! If you don't have any possessiveness then why don't you go into open relationship.

Say those things when you are first yourself beyond those things.

Reviewing questions multiple Tee time till you have them.at instantaneous clicks, 

yee to bss ratna hai.

We are doing this so you have enough food for pattern recognition to become hyperactive in very little time.

(Create an emotional, comppasionate answer and an agressive answer. The answer you just wrote saying them mentally weak and stupid is emotional.

Don't be emotional fool and do what will give you best social++

Just simple convey

Say repeation is done for speed and repetion done for understanding are different

Why repetition help?

Acknowledge now boring tedious and hard it is.)

I think that's very arrogant statement as a way to dismiss but let me give you an analogy about ratna.

From my perspective it feels like someone coming to me and saying 

"In my life i have never memorize table from 1-10.

Whenever i see multiplication i do it with understanding not memory by  

7x8

That is 7 rows 8 cloumns.

1.2..3..4.5…..

And worse taking pride in that.

That is how it looks to me.

Just because you don't waste time in stupud things won't make you dumb

You will get more than enough opportunities to test your understanding in micktest and new book

I think memorizing is just another function and capability of mind and we have to use gifts which were given to us.

You don't do only memorization or no memorization.

Optimal and right way.

And i think such basic things most people don't keep to themselves in ignorance cause memorizing and repution is boring and tedious andiy requires lot of mental strenth

Compar d to just learning new things and understanding concepts is very engaging and rewarding process.

Repeation is not.

I think more of reason for someone saying this sentence is 

"Memorizing is boring, hard, tedious.

And understanding is super easy and it's engaging,

So you lie to yourself to run away from hardwork.

Programming - for family 

Art (writting , drawing) - for just myself

Comtrolling impulse

–

Shutdown thinking don't do metnal war, stay with unchanging and act 

—---

Now First i will have to tell what is my mental schema about 

Mind, sensation, control so you can better understand where i am coming from  

I learn this from a book and this is somehow i see but with little modification

My way of seeing is three components exists

Mind (chatter, dialogue with one self)

Sensation 

Memory of past, goals of future, other products of thinking stored

Now three of them are constantly in circular relationship constantly affecting each other.

Mind's work is to send you notification, make sure we are in control, all the tasks are being executed correctly, task manager of sorts.

Now if i have decided that i will do something set 'a will' for myself then i will get a reminder when i will be  about to break that will. 

That's it for my mental scehma let me explain my mental process when an impulse comes to me for continutaion

I am 

Ex- i set goal for myself for dieting before sleeping, next day normly went by and i am lost in flow, my friend offers me chips let's say 'my mind will send me a notification '  that i decided to fats but suppose if my resolve wasnt strong enough 

Now it wilnt happen like jsut because i didn't have resolve i will just snatch away chjopd packet from my friend

There will be a hesitation and to push off that hesitations debate will happen in my mind  b/w 'my resolve' & 'my mind that has been hijacked by sensation' 'hijacked mind will automatically adjust my resolve to fit completing of desire' like i will start it from 'sham see' 'this is an exception/special'

Now i see almost like a needle fluctuating between two extreme . Now if i give in to temptation then most of the times what happens with me is    'sensation logic will somehow convince me its okay , now even if i say it's okay somehow in background my will

Will saying in very small voice 

'no, no' protesting voice will still exist but i will just shutdown my.thinking and act on impulse.

Mind - MY MOTHER AND FATHER ARE HINDU. I DON’T BELONG TO ANYTHING.

OtherHuman - hindu (cuz it will create friendliness and bonding~, don’t miss the chance, take a dip!)

If there are let's 10k problems then the amount of patterns you need to solve them all will be 200. If you know those 200 in and out . You can derive it, intuit it,.then you will become a god literally.

Cuz you can tell method of approach in a question in one glance, or maybe the question will be cover in packet so you will just have to pull that packet then you will be able to see what's inside and how to solve.

The chance that a new question that you have never seen will comes is close to zero BECUZ, to come up with question that isn't likeany of 10k someone has to be a creative genius and with his most effort he will only pull out putting a difficult to remove packet, chances of coming with question whose inside the packet you wont be able to identify is close to none and if someone comes up, genius of genius with it, then hardly anyone will be able to solve it, either through luck or maybe another genius of genius?

WHY DO YOU USE LOT OF PURE HINDI?

Actually the story behind it is, that 

I had insecurity when i was small about totla pan in certain sounds and words

so whenever while speaking, i would be about to say a word whose pronunciation i knew i will mess up, 

I WILL PAUSE AND THAT DOUBT WILL COME SHOULD I SPEAK THIS WORD OR NOT?

Alternatives will comes in mind 

SO OUT OF WORDS THAT COME TO MIND WILL BE ONES FROM Sbd Arth Hindi

And it looked like whenever i was using SUDH HINDHI just in flow of normal words, it’s kind of erratic

My friends will find it funny 

SO IT BECAME A HABIT AND NOW I DON’T HAVE TO PAUSE AND THINK 

I THINK PERFECT AND IMPERFECT PEOPLE THIS STUFF IS BAKWASS. 

AND IF YOU HAVE TO USE PERFECT AND IMPERFECT THEN 

‘IMPERFECT IS IMAGE OF PERFECT HUMAN BEING.’

And this all stuff, perfection, imperfection is ANIMALISTIC.

IF today i wish to create perfect pet.

Then what should i do.

Gouge out eyes of rabbit fior eyes.

For brain go to dog and cut him open cuz dogs are loyal.

Cut off peacocks wings,

Abd i go to ask that blow life into it (isme fuuuk maardo taki yee zinda hojaye)

AND NOW WE HAVE THE PERFECT PET?

Do looks matter?

Casual1) If i can meet someone who gets my complete core fully then maybe i can, but that's very less likely. 

More closer friendly) but you see fit that someone has to go through same experience as me and chance if i meet that person and person is mentally healthy and will not pull me down in the hole i climb away from is zero. 

Second maybe i need someone who eminates positivity to light my negative heart.

Vague Answer For Stranger 

9th class - new school hated it

10th class - normal kind of.

10end-11thDecember depressed, decided not to go to Kota cause seeing normal  happy humans will make my depression worse.

12th - trying to break free from my depression cause if things remain the same then in college , i know i will just lock myself in a room , talk to bare minimum, cause i can’t show these emotions.

(I will have to

and my depression will worsen more and more 

I JUST CANT SEE A HOPEFUL FUTURE, WHERE ANYTHING GETS BETTER MORE HOPEFUL FOR ME.

Will have to wait till mom dies so i can finally rest too and won't have to carry this facade for everyone but before that they will probably made arrange marriage for me which i willnt want cause whoever i will only make the person who married me sad since i am always -ve, i just want to remian in my closed room, never wanting to do anything else.  

 but i was doing class 11&12 maths, along trying to make a game so these pursuits gsve me lot of strength of Persevere 

Do you belive in destiny? SoulMates?

Yes i do, i think for us to meet, ever since my birth there has to be so many coincidenced otherwise we willnt even be talking, maybe we will be total strangers.

And even before that so many coincidences have to have happen which will have to trace back to beginning of all.

And we had no control over anything that happened in past.

And when i try to reflect back things couldn't have happened any other way than this one.

The situation, the environment, limitations, i was put in i had no choice but to choose this road only. 

But present moment is alive, wriggling, but PAST everything is DEAD but without the -ve implication that is normally placed on dead. It's beautiful in its own right. But past maybe dead, present is wiggling. 

I think it was intevitable 

Soulmates

Since the dawn of time it was destined for us to meet , everything happened and bought us to this moment.

And now i have opportunity to change/shape our romance it whatever way we want.

We are bounded(non-choosable things) but unbounded (choices) at same times

WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ABSOLUTE CHOICE BUT HAVE IN LOCAL WAY .

We are caged but we can move within cage.

AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY CAGE AS -ve word, cuz 

You can say lion is caged in zoo. 

Lion is caged in Jungle.

Lion is caged in african continent.

But that necessarily isnt bad thing.

Freedom and cage are value judgements.

Choice and choicelessness are value judgements

My views on male-,female friendship is,

The word friendship only tells maybe an value structure

Friendship have two components

Value exchange what i and you give.to each other. You get something from 

is set of rules the two will agree to follow.

Help your friend in trouble, if someone tries to do something to you i will too fight for you. These all are some values that in being followed we will call this friendship.

what values are being exchanged

People hardly have enough character to stick to values so it's more of MUTuAL EXPLOITATION.

Having the values and rules you abide by is what turns value exchange into soemthing more holy but sigh.

Ex- mom dad maybe give little to exploit but as you are there child they follow certain inbuild values that they will always and always help you and other stuff those Resolves in a sense make it holy.

Why is sticking to resolve is less to never followed cause we value exploits from exploitation so much that resolves and other parts becomes irrelevant yet we continue to pretend that it's friendship cause maybe we will be too ashamed to be outright direct like that so we hide behind the holy mask.

We can maybe bind holy by vowing THAT HOW MUCH I VALUE AND APPRECIATE YOU IS NOT ATTACHED TO THE EXPLOITS, I WANT TO SERVE THE PERSON WHO IS EXPERIENCING THE REALITY BEHIND THE EYES, AND ENHANCE THEIR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE.

Why do you love FL?

-I don’t like the phrasing. If you want to know the things i love about FL. I can tell that. 

BUT WHY DO I LOVE FL is just because it’s my internal vow OF DEVOTION. to take care and want to enhance the experience of the person who is behind the flesh.

Now there may be reasons which lead me upto making the vow. 

BUT IT’S VOW THAT MATTERS not the reasoning that lead up to that.

It's the beginning of a new string. IT’S DETACHED FROM IT.

Even if you don't provide me with any of the exploits, i will still treat you right and respectfully.

Y

I am not attached to keep getting supply of exploits but serving you but you too will have to continue sticking to your resolves.

It's a contract

I deem you worthy

So from hereon we will…

Nice people doing it to get something, so it's exploitative and bad.

Huh, i thnk its misunderstanding of how things and world works.

Doing for others= virtue so he loved.

everyone is doing value exchange, giving and taking, i am not saying it's good or bad. But that is how it is you are not some clean and good human being and the person who does thing is bad person who is looking to exploit.

Don't lie to yourself.

Why do girls wear makeup? If you like to look pretty then shouldn't it at be home and everytime? Right. Why just outside, you gain something by doing that.

MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD, I HAVE WASTED SO SO MUCH TIME BENDING MYSELF TO LIVE UPTO IMAGE PEOPLE HAVE OF ME.

Happiness and satisfaction of Piku level people in my life>> MY GOALS & MY FORWARD MOVEMENT >>>> Living upto Image

My gradma & father don't know me. She hasn't even heard an single story of my life, what i like to do in freetime, what gives me happiness, what gives me satisfaction 

I DON'T BLAME THEM AS THEY WERE NEVER GIVEN TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND ME EVEN ON SURFACE LEVEL.

But i willn't bend my satisfaction and happiness to uphold to their illusion.

TODAY I WILL STAY AWAKE UNTIL I HAVE FINISHED WHOLE IOC

GOAL ISN'T EFFIECIENCY IT'S TO UPHOLD MY WILL, I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE TO WORK LIKE TOROISE FOR NEXT 20 hours cuz of sleepiness what matters is ME STICKING TO MY WILL. 

I DO CARE FOR THAT AND I'LL TRY TO SOOTHE THEM BUT NLY WHEN I HAVE POWER

how should i put it, i don't have much good enough example. I am taking extreme example and ge tgist of what is my feeling.

I heard story how in old times, maybe when female fails to concieve male child she was thought as defective and many times husband remarries.

So what happened here was women was a tool for man and his family to FULFILL A FANTASY. Or maybe get A TOOL 'MALE CHILD'.

Now what happens if new iphone or expensive laptop i bought stops meor is hanging a bit too much.

I'll be angry and disappointed,

I would not treat  it the same way i would have if it worked normally.

SIMILARY, if women TOOL would have served it's function it would have been treated nicely but it didn't ypu either try to fix or replace it and if you dont have money for both THEN LIVE WITH IT WHILE YOU CUSS It .

Isn'et it nice. I still , ave so many experiences to look forward to. (I won't waste my sleep thinking about it cause if i never experience something 'i don't know it' and if i don't know it.

Then it's as good as being imaginary.

And even i have heard words about , words can never capture an experience.)

 the rush of collecting and accomplishing everything fast?

Who am I fighting? Why am I fighting? Before death will k even care about fights.

Fish who live and die in ocean never realises it was in ocean, it may have few glimpses here there but only the fish who is dragged out river by fisherman understand it was living in river.

The sadness gives taste to happiness otherwise the 'pure happiness is just tasteless you won't even value it'

Everything is holy

Only nothingness can be free. If you are something, you will be inbondage. If you are, you will be in bondage. Only a void, a vacant space,can be free. Then you cannot bind it.

I have began too see emotions such as happiness/ sadness/ anger / irritation as not part of me but more of an instict. An instinct which carries a message

Will is biological process whose is kind of 

Task_Manager —-> ensure that whatever the storyline i am holding in my head there is movement towards that.

If i have decided that i will diet, eat less,blah,

The way i see motivation and resolutions have changed because of this

The reason why i can't stick to my goal wasn't lack of motivation. From motivation I expect that when the moment of sensory possession comes, the right before my mind anticipate desire is about to possess me. I get reminder that disperses/pushof that possession for some second.

but it is more like a buff and its potency decreseases with time. I can again remind myself of my resolve and i will gain buff again but of less potency. Again more less potency. and then a point comes where potency wll be so loww that sensation will bypass it and invade and bend my thinking.  The reason for chipping away is that -  even though both are made from same elelment but enivornment supports the will from sensations while my motivation for another will breathes in different air. It’s not battle winnable by win and even if i win, after so long i will loose. 

We can say rely on habits but thats kind of distasteful.

MY APPROACH HAS CHANGE TO DEAL WITH CULPRIT HERE WHICH IS THE SENSATION I AM FEELING AND THE WAY TO DEAL IT IS. I HAVE TO REdIRECT IT BUT REDIRECT WORD DON’T CARRY MEANING PRECISELY. IT’S MORE LIKE I AM MOLESTING THE SENSATION ITSELF BY BODY WILL AUTMOTICALLY REDIRECT WHATEVER.

My emotions and world will not chew on me. I will be the one who eats and devours.

When i think of acting revenge on someone. I see it as a last thing that after the punishment is delt with the punished will stop existing

Each achivement and tradegy of different multitude are different yet all the same. 

Even if they were always happy, no pain was ever inflicted, still this whole melodrama tragic.

One set of karma in certain order will be key to many locks which need to be opened to access earthly stuff but all this will always remain earthly 

Watching EUPHORIA is a  spiritual experience you won't be able to forget even if you try.

It will just char you.

You willnt remain the same man as you are now.

You will be reborn anew

Why i will never feel jealous/envy of a monkey with harem? Why i don't understand. 

Shouldn't he be in so much pleasure and happiness. Why i don't feel envious of such happiness or pleasure. Why does human chimp excite me so much?

Isn't it just the image i have attached to words and object.

In the extistentail sense i don't desire pleasure or the completion of story. These pursuits are only to run away from pain and  boredom.

The very process ll ll they go through creates the ego. The fight is the process. If you fight, you're bound to create an ego. And the more you fight, the more strengthened the ego will be. And if you win your fight, then you will achieve the supreme ego.

(When two people fight their goal focus on getting ego up & their point validated 

Reason i gave up making game (noone d interested in hearing why you didn't do something so don't talk about it, unless other person is super close to you)

I think the external scenarios forced me to quit.

I think which was mainly caused due to my father being transferred to new place

-   I used to use my computer for running uneral engine and computer needs electricity and electricity will only come in midnight from 11pm-3am or 11pm-4am.

So i couldn't use my computer.

Though father had laptop of his office and i tried running unreal engine in it. Laptop was weak and slow and it can't handle the burden it takes to learn ue4 software so it will hang a lot.

But i was still passionate about this, so i tried to not get irritated, and try to work with what little i can do in slow hanging laptop.

-   And if that wasn't enough my house d in middle of nowhere so there are very weak internet signal. I can't use internet, watch tutorial video, if problem arises search for solution and the biggest problem was i can't talk to my friends.
-   I have bunch of online friends who i met through games, youtube, discord, Facebook, etc and in initially phase i tried to drag them in and get them excited about let's make video games. It will be so cool. They didn't have that discipline or work ethic but i tried again and again. They were trying too but we're too lazy by it was kind of okay becoz it gives moral support when you have someone to share and talk about your hobby and they were also taking it as their own project. 
-   What will be story like, from which game which can pickup which element, etc.
-   This all gave me lot of moral support. But our friendship and bonding was build on playing games online together, joking, enjoying. But without internet i can't even play videogsmes with them or do anymuch fun activities together. So friendships grew apart.
-   I also started doing iit syllabus, joined unacadwey and was following course so that required lot of time investment, dedicatin. Backlog was getting collected.

so i guess world just  turned agianst me. 

Why scar on face - Conflict

 Conflict b/w emotional states 

Treat every moment as last. It's not preparation for something else. -Shunryu Suzuki

I want tto journal important events in my life, instead of taking photos. Photos when i look at them after long time, it feels i am looking at stranger. Journaling carries more aliveness

Obviously dual cultivation is center of world and lot of things in it.

Why people see and take pride in it cuz it gives them sense of power that they have achieved on of the primordial goal which other have never ever seen .

Pride feels nice when you sit in it so it's completely understandable. 

When you accept that you lack something which other person have. The said person feels superiority(pride) while the one who says it feels inferior .

The sensation felt by both when this happens is biological but we shouldn't allow our souls to be occupied. Believe no story, follow no story.

There is no give and take in reality. If I wish to open the bottle cap, I turn it anticlockwise and it opens but if i were only capable of rotating clockwise then bottle would have never opened. I failed in giving bottlecap what it requires therefore i will not get what i want.

Humans are same, it's not really give and take. For a chemical reaction to move forward in certain direction, we need certain things will is not present in most as they are just heaps of gortesque patterns that chains them , they only wake up to sleep again.

When a human says they have some standards then it's just that - they have a believe that that they know all things that will fullfill them. And their lens is upgrades enough that they understand what will give how much value to them .

Both of which can never be atleast for normal humans.

Their beliefs for what they want is build through society, & entertainment stuff that's what is back of it all.

How to not let bottle know that what you want is the water inside it 

The way is to focus consiously on the cap of bottle don't let bottle know that water is what you want , even when bottle throws indication at you or situation shoes that bottle has water which will help your dry throat act as alluring as water maybe but it doesn't have what it takes to quench my thirst.

Because that is true it's not just water which is holy but everything is reality and that is truth everything is made from same thing so they all carry the same holy element putting one before other is stupid 

 Sucide 

See with my weight (i am fatty), celling fan will break not my neck. (Fan my home dnt even that resilient)

And it's not like i have money or in place where i can go buy bunch of sleeping pills which when i swallow i will just go to sleep , my house is in place which is even lower than rural.

……………………..

I dont think so thd loneliness, shame, etc feeling are unbearable for me. 

 My biggest fear is that my body will get emotional and start to cry.

Even if i am not crying internally, tears can automatically come in my eyes.

Now crying in front of others too isn't something too problematic for me.

But it becomes problematic when others can deduce and find my weakness.

Even then finding weakness isn't a problem, it will only strengthen bond more, but it becomes a problem 

When they will bend and warp the real weakness into some wrong and weird image due to lack of experience. 

THAT MISUNDERSTANDING, THAT WARPING IS THE PROBLEM.

-   I don't want them to make me tragic heroine in their mind.
-   I don't want them to see me as weak?

I felt weak due to circumstances i was put in. It is okay to comprehend but we can attach few traits of the person as the real person and not see the real one.

I think the moment we can see the real one But the moment we bring an image of the person in

But karma of perosn is the only thing you can base their behaviour on

LL……………

 My theory is we consider people their qualities (good or bad)

Like kind, mischeavious, arrogant etc we attribute behaviours of the person as person itself.

But isn't those behaviour just mode in which person interacts with world, 

The being that is sitting and watching inside can't be given that quality.

Yes people in love may not even see or think about the real person itself.

What they may love is just image, just few qaulities they have attributed to how that person is.

THEY NEVER See THE REAL PERSON WITHIN.

Because moment you attribute the behaviour of person as real perosn you have corrupted.

I am too rich to call myself a poor beggar.

I mean think about nice friendships with ayush, with Kunal, with Arpan. Just how many people in the world will get to experience that is meaningful, so amazing, that doesn't mean there weren't movement where the reality didnt worked like archtypes but stil still, it was amazing, the coincidence, the luck it will take for something same is infinite.

Remeber sumo, just how much i debt owe her. How much deluded will i be if it wasn't for her. How much confidence i got from her. Hoe grateful i am to her for moving heart so deeply such a compassionate soul.

I was able to notice the difference in world between Stanford and CristuJyoti because I had horrible experience in cjc so for a beggar stanford was too luxurious of a drink obviously i will feel like i am in heaven .

Remember esha mam, shweta mam, 5th class science mam who gets to enjoy this much pleasure. I was the only one in the class who got that pleasure. Rudra and Monika mam although it was rough ride, without two of them, my life would have been stale. Rudra was narcissistic but still it's not his fault, he was a really fun person to be around and he opened so many doors for me which if it wouldn't been for him would be impossible to even see and imagine that it's possible.

In 9th class too. Kartike influenced and ungraded in me way that was unique. He taught me about my own toxicity. How much of toxic tendency and person I was.

Adiba curiosity?

I already got enough

I think i should hide things about past i don't want to talk about.... cuz vague answer will make them interpret things on their own accord, bend them and not see real

(DON’T CHOOSE ANYTHING NOT EVEN THESE CONDITIONS YOU JUST WROTE)

World exists for me, not I for the world. I mean what  will i even give to others, all I can see are mechanical and wasteful things. There’s not a lot worth much that i will be ready to bow for it.

I HAVEN’T FIND ANYTHING WORTH SHARING AND WORTH SHARING ARE EPHEMERAL.

I AM TOO CONFLICTED AND DIVIDED WITHIN MYSELF                                  

TRAITS IN LUB

Someone who will listen to me, like arpan and will have openness to explore new hobbies territories.like arpan kind of

Looks and My Satisfaction Initial Matter

(I am disgustingly logical, cunning, etc (vision(even if i don’t act - I see)). 

I can break all morals & values that i pretend to be my own

AND WHEN TIME TO EXPERIENCE GUILT COMES I CAN ESCAPE.

THere’s NO ACT THAT WILL MAKE ME FEEL REGRET/GUILTY BEFORE DEATH

I KNOW AND UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH

I don't want other person to usurp any such seeds inside me in.

Cause i don’t know if i can/will control myself.

I have bended and accepted order and things even if i didn’t like it for so long. I DON’T WANT TO FEEL ENSLAVED OR IT SHOULD ATLEAST BE WORTH PRESERVING, NOT oNLY NEWNESS otherwise i am not going to hand all my this LifeWork to just anyone.

Cuz i know when i am with someone I WANT TO SPEND REST OF MY LIFE WITH THEM.

If it’s just variety, new novel experiences, prostitutes is better w hen I become enough age (i’ll find someone for long)

ATHEISM

I think humans arent equipped enough to create right conception of god.  I wonde rif it’s something intellect can’t grasp.

It feels like two tadpoles trying to understand about theory of reality thats sound stupid.

think humans are just accident of this divine play or whatever the world is.

And we shoudltn be capable of capable of even taking about God until we have senses, some power that is on the plane of creator and i don't we have that we are so weak and just slaved/bounded to everything. comparable to god

think we aren't equipped enough to understand or talk about about God.

I think maybe intellect is just not capable of understanding the form or nature of who created world? 

WHY I LOVE ISEKAI.

It's the adventurous feeling of travelling to a  'world beyond our own' that I really savor in Isekai anime.

Earth is kind of good but it just lack that sparkle of magic.

There are glimpses of beauty now and then but elsewise it's the same things repeating themselves over again.

To different people you maybe different character to all but to yourself you are always the same. So to jsut drop that normal self character name/ PhysicalBody/ goals/ dreams/ desires other limitations and runaway in faraway place for brief time.

The blandness gives glamour to beauty, but if everything is beautiful then it will become bland once again.

Without a pinch of fantasy, normal-life is kind of bland. (Don't use -ve sentence bland is negative)

Just remembering the first days when i stumbled on

-DemonLordRetry -SlimeIsekai -SwordArtOnline

I get filled with this inexplicable feeling, i can’t really put into words just how much my core, my entire being was shaken that something so BEAUTIFUL even exist.

And anime worked as gateway to runaway from all the pain that i was suppressing.

BUT WHAT JUST BROKE ME INTO PIECES WAS 

Mobesuke manga then light novel

AND I CAN’T EVEN PUT NUMBER. WORDS WILL BE LESS TO DESCRIBE THE FEELING.

Except for one incident in my life, this was THE HAPPIEST, THE MOST INTENSE I have ever felt, not even comparing them will be false.

It was really suprising cause till now max of my best happy moments were where people other than me were involved too, maybe goal but even goal accomplishing is outer too.

I was in this another world, exploring, experiencing. 

I stay awake for greater than 24hrs just reading reading reading.

Nothing else was on my mind except the novel or better would be Nothing else in the world was so capable of pulling my attention.

When i went to sleep i was only able to sleep for 2 hrs. Even though last day i was awake for long time but sheer excitment just awoke me. 

On waking up my eyes were literally burning due to not getting enough sleep and 

my vision was hazy too and the first thing i did after jumping up from my bed was opening laptop —> novelpdf with my burning eyes 

And it's really painful to stare at screen when eyes are burning but i was just a completly mad person at that point.

For whole day again i ddint thought of even a single day except the novel.

And soon after 20-23hrs of staying awake i was feeling sleepy blmy head will automatically crash doen from time to time but even that didn't broke my spirit, my enjoyment of the novel and i only slept after i finally finished it

ZERO BELIEVER GODDESS.

All my real world related problems just dissolved

Japanese Korean Chinese Novels

Have an quality about them that make you feel that the book I am reading is my world and my earth identity has become kind of irrelevant .

English movies,etc makes you feel more like an observer it can pull you long but you don't get lost in it so badly the real world turns irrelevant.

i love having bestfriend and like idea of love cause in that i can create a new reality which is private. They don’t need to understand me! I was content with Arpan even if he didnt played video games or science, maths. I was still happy with him.

WITH ARPAN YOU DON’T THINK MORE BEST-FRIEND BETTER

HE ISNT A RESOURCE OR TOO.

YOU THINK WITH FL CAUSE SHE IS IMAGINARY/

SECURITY

I have more than enough gifts to afford beauty. I can even afford luxurious beauty but 

i will be content with minimum beauty criteria filled (level i can be content with), 

ONCE MIN CRITERIA MET

My focus will be on personality & judge using instinct

I want to write novel, i have been , but still chaos, i don’t think my writting skills are matured enough, i want to improve my imagination more rich by learning more of history, culture, mythology, politics, philosophy,GoodNovels/Stories, i don’t even know how long will it take but it kind of doesn’t matter.

Synopsis i am not fixed and everything can still change but kind of story i planned on is 

Story takes place in medivial fantasy world where cultivation.

In kingdom, 4  XYZ who were most accomplished, clever, cunning scholar.

In feud MC framed so he was sent to jail.

But …..not fixed…. A terrorist attack happens or mc finds a chance somehow and slips or whatever but MC mangage to run away but he is still being chased. 

MC is fugitive. He will not even get chance to meet family cuz he is fugitive, 

SO STORY IS ABOUT HOW MC USING LIES/ TRICKERY and his cunningness he will rise back. FANTASY-MYSTERY-ROMANCE TYPE.

I want to draw illustrations for my novel that’s why i don't know how long will take to bring everything to fruition but i want it to take long.

Desire to right a book 

Last quarter of 2021 September oct nov  (17+-1 years old)

Idea of Having only child & devoting whole life to serve humanity

I think, if i have power to donate, help others a little i will do that 

BUT I DON’T LIKE EXTREME THINGS

If you are just having one child for humanity then why don’t you do other things too.

-

I am not here to be a robot and serve humanity because all of them have the same type of brain, consciousness, etc as me.

I will only devote my life for FAMILY and maybe ART COMMUNITY not for whole humanity and everything.

AND AREN'T YOU JUST DROWNING YOURSELF IN ALTRUISM

AND I WANT TO KNOW, you can use 3-4 roti and feed 500s ant with it, 

but we willn’t consider it 

I WILL HELP IF I HAVE POWER BUT I willn’t devote my life to it.

My devotion is only to exploration art, history, stories, how things work.

That should be done out of completely full your central being and not out of GUILT TRIPPING OR ALTRUISM

.

We will have only one life and i willn’t stop myself from experiencing and living the way i want just for SAKE OF HUMANITY

I think it would be fun to have hoem bustling with kids, it will take lot of efforts, energy use but I DON'T THINK AT all it will be LIFE NOT WORTH WORKING HARD FOR.

AND I THINK KIDS, family, child will BE BIG PART OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE, i mean just look around every animals mate,

IF YOU WANT ME TO DO OTHERWISE AND CONVINCE ME, THEN SHOW ME SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND CAPTIVATING THAT 

THOUGHT THAT I CLOSED OFF AND LIMITED MYSELF AND NOT GHAVE KIDS WILL FEEL WORTH IT.

So me something so i won’t regret or ReThink my choices ever ever again

IF PIKU’S CONVICTION IS 100% STRONG, SHE WILL NEVER REGRET OR RETHINK IN FUTURE, then I WILL RESPECT THAT AND DO SAME AS HER cuz if piku value something so h igh then i will do it too. BUT IF JUST out of demoralize self - earth population, kitni kaam mehnat, tension hogi THEN I REFUSE 

AND I THINK IT’S PURE ARROGANCE TO SAY WE HUMANS ARE BEYOND ANIMALS SO WE WILL NOT DO THAT STUFF.

I THINK OUR BIOLOGY IS MAJOR MAJOR PART OF OURFESLVES AND YOU CAN’T CUT IT OFF.

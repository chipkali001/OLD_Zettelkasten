There was powercut and I heard sound loud from aagan like someone has jumped over wall and entered from there.
I was in front of laptop and I knew howvee is standing there can see my face and I can't see them so my heart just stopped in tracks. 
Oh shit! A robber.
My heart froze for second.
I didn't have any weapon the only stock is there near that gate. 
 I had phone at distance length so my idea first was to throw my phon, then pickup my chair to cover it my head and troso. 
And then go there and use it to smash their hwads
(I thought I should maybe shout and alert parents but papa is old he doesn't have strength to someone who climbed up and broke door)


When you explain robotics tell in detail what you used to do. 
Show them avishkar kits through net.
Tell themabout competition.
How in 6th class it was stay after school and it felt so cool, that whole school is deaf and silent up
Now before this i was in really really strict school, it felt like I have lived my whole life till now in jail and i am seeing world beyond jail for first time 
In it there was system i thin like
Year1- mechanics rype mam was there. 
Year2- programming 
Our year2- club systemo teacher came but he was sir and didn't teach programming.
Gahgan bhiya class11-12 went to gurgaon, paid to learn programming.
For me i downladed tere software and in software there was options where you can load 3formats sample program (IR, eetc, etc).
I just looked at it and instantly got the idea for what I should do. 



A. Advantage take little, lie little
B. Full blown betrayal easy path. 
1) me accusing first reduces chances
2) even if they do - i can before they tell, i can go ask sir, in front of both **CAN I CHaNGE MY SEAT?**
3) i can maybe distract kartieky with taunts 
4. Sir pushed me for answer after shutting kartikey
5. Fuck!. Now mind was thinking if I say something anbonly kartikey gets punished then later the two will gang up and tell sir. 
6. I am in advantage my words have greater weightage sir didn't even allow him to finish
7. But I will loose credibility score in his mind. 
8. I knew the answer too what should I do.
9. Before they complain about me i can false complain about them.
10. Tell ki wo dono meere kaan mei words kh rha thee, aur dono mujhe aaise pareshan krte hain, maa jaha baiththa hun wahi kartikey mujh bechare ko pareshan krne aa jaatjaata hain.
11. Subhankar isn't in position to defend himself or listen inly kartikey will and he is in far weaker position.
12. So this way even the future of them complaining about mewon't come as i have primed first towards my story.
13. Even if I see them doing , before they go to sir, i will myself go to sir and ask him **please change my seat and say them to not follow me** 
14. Pr problem yee thii kii mei kartikey ko too mei Ganda/bad insaan Manta tha ( i will explain later) paar shubhankar mere dost thas.
15. Kartieky ko bure hone kii wajah see,mere morals mee jhut bhoolna aur uske expense khudko aaise position me rakhna jaha mujhe power milegi right tha
16. Pr shubhankar mera friend hain aur wo aacha inssaan hsin
17. Pr mere dimag mee ek parallel voice thii yee Puri problem hii kiski wajah see hain?
18. Meri mummy ki baat nhi hoti to yee sb hota hi nhi, mujhe Bina baat kee uss uss situation me Jana pda, **they too deserve to be treated unfairly** 
19. Aur mere dimag mee reasons aa raa rhe thee ki shubhkar ko bhi kuue mei dhkka Dena kyu sahi hain.
20. I was trying to control my urge. 
21. Sir nee mujhe waapas see pucha, actually mei abhi tk sharma rha thas yaa uska naatakkrr rha thaa
22. Kyuki mujhe agar aaisi situation mei Jana padta hai jaha mujhe jhut bolna hai, paar mene khud see loopholes fill nhi kiye hai aur mujhe time chahiye 
23. To sharmane see dekhte hei ki meikoi existing chiiz koxhuppa rha hun naaki apne dimag mei koi new story carve krr rha hun.
24. Depending on situation mei sharmane ko bhi halka chupaunga ki wo notice kre ki mei Sharm ko chupa tha yun
25. Aur jisse phele mei jhut bolu, mei usshi insaan see puchunga ki "tumhe kya lgta hai?""
26. Jo wo guess krenge usko hi repeat kro thoda modify krke
27. I will be like tumne kaise guess Kiya, expressson see hi ki wow tumne kaise Kiya, tum bhot smart hon. Just expression aur words see implicitly bolkr 
28. **NOT possible with sir, cause he is in angry mode, so it's not possible to play games, *he want direct answer words kee saath play karna possiblenhi hain***
29. Back to story, now sir is asking for answer and i can't betray my values. 
30. So I just stood silent, mere dimag meri aur ideas aa rhe thee like, (i couldn't choose anything and **felt it willnt work**)
31. Joke- Sir asslel baate kr rh thee
32. Mei bolu kii instead of kartikey aur shubhankar milkr mujhe preshan krr rhee thee whole story mei kartikey koo enemy bnau (same story)
33. Bolne kee passe shubhankar kee pass jauu aaur usse uthakr bolu **gusse me ki kartieky uss samay yee kr rha thaa** shubhankar waise bhi confused hai aur uska response matter nhi krega as long as **mene enough guuse aur assertionko show Kiya hon I HAVE BEEN Treated unjustly** kartikey will get beaten
34. He believes i whisper things against him in his ear. So asking as i make it appearki shubhankar is on my side, we hate you,so he may not try.
35.  And i can distract him, by laughing at him, he is arrogance, ego so big, so I can delay & distract. Galli gallooj distract him. Enough time kii baat purrani ho jaye. 
36. Bhot hssi aa rhi thee, waise bhot bnte ho, kya kroge ab, sir ka jaake chuusoge/rooge ki sir sir yee jhut bol Raha Han haaha. **dusri trf mud kr hasna aur time to time uski taraf dekhna**
37. But everything was in my head, u didn't trust it, and i felt i am betraying shubhankar by taking advantage of his friendliness which i thought of as pure so using that for my advantage was something I felt disgust. 
38. So I didn't knew what to say, i am telling you in words but Everything was there in my all at once in intuition mene words mee soch nhi rkha thaa, jaroorat nhi thii, and i was confused what to say, whether to betray shubhankar.


Humans outside play in simplified/shallow terms Te. 
Topr? - maths excellent 
**backbencher**-yup (metaphoicallz in the essence they are talking about)

Aur 11tg 12th me opportunity nhi mili, tbto bdi body see teacher ko intimidate krskr ho ki **Jayda chedoge to tum pit skte hon**
So I am middlebencher
(Human first then profession then age)

1. Talking what to principal sir
2. It was enjoyable moment for m QQe. Really good wind was blowing in corridor.
3. When I looked @kartikey there was an urge to smile. Mind reader 
4. But I knew vengagnce/ revenge they will try to take 
5. And actually i know source of iu know how that mind readering thing started
6. Small incident, stood for Halla maachane kee liye. Actually they were at front of me so dare
7. To increase possibility of **escaping** i try just put on gloomy mood ~~Mujhe lga if I try to act~~  sad and gloomy shell make me sit down.
8. (Don't act cocky by being like male willnt notice they are dumb and stuff )
9. She made me sit down siprisingly. Kartieky and subhankar scremesded
10. I will still be miserable here sitting, ohtisdr class, principal everywhere what will it change really
11. Mam kicked then out
12.  **Don't say this** They both were angry & i didn't knew if they expected to me to say to mam, kick me out too? They didn't noticed my mood. They were the one who were loud but I got wrapped up with them? Did they protest? Really?
13. That thing evolved into whole poaching isolation divide&rule , he can see my tactics & read my brain



If i told sir to change my seat, in front of then, they'll look stupid if htey try to complain about me after that.
I can trigger him so he ta kes upon his ego to deal with me and not cyr to sir.

If i show no resistance (when they ask to hit me to even out), they cant hit me as hard. Their hit was never to inflict pain but just SYMBOLIC purpose


I felt with kartikey i can put my self-interest first, bad person. WHICH WAS JUST AN EXCUSE to GIVE MEYSELF REASON to do this.
If they ally themselves and tell sir. Problem was that i cant speak against shubhankar, cuz my conscience wont allow it, with kartikey i can give myself excuse but shubhankar was nice funny, friendly perosn. 
it just felt wrong & way was just simple if they ally theselves and go to sir, jkust before them, in front of them, go ot sir and aks Change my seat. THIS WILL REINFORCE what i said to him earlier and they'll most like not say but even if they say, they'll be seen as stupid.

Arpit monkey I thought baghwan punished him for being bad friend and failing to communicate, then trying to run away

It wasnt like i don't knew  who were dogs. or i  didnt knew in rthe end, this is not going to worl, but i had childish hope that hings will change, A MIRACLE WILL HAPPEN.


How u got scar?
Bhedbhav 
(.....with someone i have known for my life.  )

1. English teacher 
2. Taken away
3. First shikayat will be , hold pride in being mom's good boy
Gotup and look down i have already decided to go, but wanted to give a last try. I tried **persuading**
I have already mentally prepared to go down.
Now there was pass you had to take and they had made compulsory to wear that. 
It didn't fit in pocket.
Now there was also a class on ground from what I saw & that way was in front do i felt i can blend in. It will look little off going in area where I can't go but they probably wontbothrr following or trying to stop me. If they did i will run.

I was completely in fight or flight.
Then another things happened.
I heard peeeee sound of door opening. The door which was closest to aagan door.



Now where to go? there was apoorv in class. He went to aakash, good in studies and he had a loner personality. I didn't see him taking much with anyone. 
He sat alone. 
Now one thing with apoorv was kartikey and shubhankar actually kind of hated him (i wasn't aware i thought they are bad people)cuz in sanik school exam and other exam when they asked him in school whether he iwl give he said no but he came anyway so when they spooteed him, he just pretended to not know them. for them it was him thinking that he is better than both of them and don't consider them to be value enough to talk. He looked at them as clown.
So that hurted their ego and they will try to find opportunity to make fun of him. He had roll number 6 so he will call him 6 and tease him like that. 
But what I hated was then trying to find opportunity to call him 6 in front of class. It REALLY MADE ME ANGRY. But j didn't knew what to say, "you can't do that it's bad to tease others"
So I just told myself  their core is evil, they are insensitive human beings. They are unchangable. 
**so that resulted me in not doing anything. Actually the reason why kartieky blamed me for poaching shubhankar. 
Kartikey seemed to lack compassion and narcissism made him more blind. When we will talk naturally on text he will complain to me about shubhankar that e is this and he is that, i didn't like it, don't do it behind back. Auntiyo wali chisse**
First i try to told him to not care about such menial things. Let's talk about other stuff.  
*now that didn't changed the behaviour*
Parallel to this, i ugh have to explain. This all is really complicated i really ahve to spend lot of mental power out this all in words. 
Earlier i used to think of my mind as castle, 
Which has walls of different heights 
At the center of castle is garden where I live and beyond every wall is garden/museum.
This garden has stories, things, words the things I will say to VISITOR.
Which part of stories, how will I say things, what implicitly, what explicitly, i will cut, which emotion/feeling i willnt show.
Aim of each garden is to test whether visitor has qualification to open next wall, and grooming the person and preparing the person so they can understand/appreciate the next garden. 
Now I considered kartikey to be close friend and shubhankar to be not so close. So I showed kartiey more garden than i did subhankar and he will talk to shubhankar in front of me.  
For me garden was sacred place so 
and i really hated him for talking so openly to just anyone. 
You know like in temples/church/architect you're not allowed to take pictures, because taking picture of it violated purity. 
***Am I making sense? Or me saying temple, garden, photo not allowed i am talking to myself***
Let me tell to you in simple terms 
If you tell me something about yourself that you usually don't talk/share to anyone and then u find me laughing about it with your friends, will it make you angry?
Why? You never told me to keep it secret? But it was **sacred/divine** to you which held meaning and i have invited an animal inside and i am spreading dongue on that sacred place. 
**you will look at me as an animal who just don't understand what is sacred.**
So my view of kartikey devolved to animal who don't know what is sacred and it's not abimsl fault for being an animal.
Kartieky badmoutherd shubhankar.
His intentions first 
1 Help him not waste time unproductive entj Te hero
2. Sadistic tum from making fun of soemone
Both were mixed in his intentions. I was aware of both.

So now coming to shubhankar 
And i considered shubhankar to be my friend so I felt it was my duty to not let this happen.
So I warned kartikey that i will send shubhankar screenshot of what you say about him. 
I thought from him spreading dongue in my castle he has no sense of purity so he willnt care. But he was angry how can I do that.
I thought he will feel shame. **But I make terrible mistake of thinking everyone thinks same as me we all have same mind. Shame is party of my personality, anger is pole he lives on.**





I don't remember exactly what I did, but I acted in way, the way I talk, my words, energy all adjusted which will encourage kartikey to express his real feeling to shubhankar and then shubhankar can know how this human really thinks of you as garbage.
My intentions were
1. Kartikey will feel like he is doing something wring and realise it
2. Shubhakar will see the real kartieky and he willnt a











you will not belive me but when I was 6yrs old I fought with monkey. Where I thorwed him on his head and he couldn't even scratch me.

I was about to say to aysh and akshat bhoya and I have an instant flashback of all the times they have told something about me to my mom. 

Don't tell tota in dev fight story cause it will pull attention and destroy tome and actual aim.


Convince easily super shad ahemed even though I was 8th class and he was college I didn't even knew knew any Te (programming language) only visual scripting.
We will talk of story omega (ecil company ) inspired godly by resident evil, i alway like film that just make me loose my sense of reality and take me into different world. I spent countless hours being in the fantasy world. 
Writting can give me sophistication.
I was too hasty or not but now I want to take my time don't rush too much. 
Convincing and playing game easy


SST SIR
14 yr old
I was expecting slap but he didn't and when 
he asked me what reason? And i looked in face.
It masde sense to , sir went through high resistance of pulling shubhankar out and beating him when closest path is me and there is so much turmoil/chaos.
And even now he asked me even when i lowered my head.
The way he is looking at me, it doesn't feel like he wants to hit me, actually unka question hi ek sense mei reason dekh rha mujhe na blame krna
It kind of clicked to me, actually he won't beat me unless i give him reason to, like in beginning i was convenient, most efficient option, yet he went to additional effort of going to shubhankar,dragging him out and then beating him
I expected sir will see me as **unki biradri ka hei**

Now when i pointed to kartikey i was aware sir mujhe abhi nhi marenge to jb shubhankar sir ko bolega tb marenge.
Reason why i pointed to kartikey was - 
Now kartikeys atitude i expected to be that he'll be like no i am not
And i will keep accusing him
In sir will beat us both
To agar sir tino ko maar denge to even wo bol de ki mene start Kiya tha to matter nhi krega

I acted likr oh aaidss bhi hua thaa, i was not fighting against what he said just oh aaisa bhi hua thaa

I got involved in conflict.
So a glass cut this off. (Pretend as if it was someone using glass to cutt you)



I turned and took name of behind me they were making laugh talking things.
Now i expected thw way kartikey will react will be *like i didn't do anything, jo Krna hai krke ddekhlo 
I will keep playing kind of victim, end me sir decide nhi kr paynge aur dono ko marenge Jo jaruri Hain kyuki wrna shubhankar ke liye me ak Ganda dost ho jaunga, usne maar khai mene nhi, ya wo sir ko bole mujhe Marne keliye kartikey kee sath join krke. Mera pitna jaarori tha
What i like about sharmana is What i have found that when i need more time to think lie properly it's best to sharm. Becox they will never think i am trying to calculate and think of good lie.
And i also feel, when you act in way, display emotions which are usually for you to pssess, you can actually insert lies and they'll not believe it's lie their natural bullshit detector don't have data are in perception mode.
But i could think of any proper answer
Ay firstbo thought maybe i can say it ashlil joke maar rhe the
But no , dono ka pitna zaarori hai, kartikey shubhankar will join hands.
I didn't knew what to do, maybe i
AND LOUDEST & BEST PATH FOR ESCAPE IT ALL was problem is kartikey and shubhankar ganging up and then making em.get beaten SO BEFORE THEY ATTACK ME i will attack them phir uske baad unke baato mei ZERO weight hoga.
Pr aaisa Krna meri morality ke against hain. I justified myself buring kartieky by telling myself he needs to get burnerd to rip his arrogance and he is and person. Shubhankar is good person even though i don't consider him my real friernd so him beaten.
Shubhankar willnt have chance to defend himself.
**but offer is so so tempting because i will loose my ability to face my mom  if  things got to her and this is my only Escape chance**
My mind told me becoz of them i got in this situation first place- i recieved unfair treatment becoz of them - i willn't have fear of mom if sir hadnt told earlier case - i am herrw unfairly becoz of this 
***Shubhankar can't even defend himself***

Child agrim traumatised by chipkali cuz
) While i was playing two chipkali fell on me from top who were fighting
Chipakli has fell on me multiple times
Falling just inches away from me
One time i woke up to find chipkali on my xhest
I would have multiple dreams jagah jagah pr chipkaliya hai aur mein khudko bacha ke Jaa rha hun.
In one dreams oot of chipkali climbed inside my clothes






I just said what cane in mind that 
Sir they were poking from behind and in your period they were annoying us from behind, we svene even asked them to not sit behind us but the two of them always come.
Sir stopped
I was too Lil confuse i thought maybe now i can go to shubhankar who is lying on ground, tell to him kartikey hme 4th class me piche see preshan kr rha tha (he will maybe accept topic has shifted to me complaining about kartieky) and he will **nodd** his head
And kartikey willnt seek his alliance since he thinks he is in my side complaining against him.
***but it was all in my mind and i didnt have faith in my intution.***
My mind was in hanging mode
maube i should get shubhankar on my side and 
for some reason i felt like i should talk about things 
After that i cident i knew it's not safe to sit with them - i don't know luck will support me next time.


Kartikey you know almost wanted to fight me, but i didn't initiated becoz result won't be good.
Fight has to happens between people of unequal stature otherwise fight will prolong till infinity.
And since kartieky is very egotistical (thump on your chest) he will fight till infinity and i can try o feign ego to maintain boundary but i don't have attachment to it.
I am more of an opportunist, i have to get something greater, some objective.

I can **prime dynamics to have more power and sir willnt loose faith in words becoz sir just blieed in my words i will break trust** , and since shubhankar isn't there to defend and kartikey is on edge. they will be defending themselve instead of accusing me. So i will retain all the power. Maybe maybe it wil work 
They'll be defending themselves so they can't accuse and even if they do i can make them look stupid




Now i have known if i try to speak and explain mam will ebat both. Plus they haven't actually given me any painful or too strong i was only brutality use.
Witj me telling at class about whole story, i wanted to prime.
Situn different if story mam first heard is in bus i was not doin anything just sitting innocently yet they kept peaking me.
Here to they came as far as in class.
(Don't tell ths story until you are comfortable to tell why didn't you want to speak much in public- i used totlana in lot of words so i wanted to avoid speaking in group.

Why will kartikey callme chalak always my friends have called bhola aur maasum

They were talking about what they'll say to principal 
I was telling them itni aachi hawa hai why aren't you enjoying view.
Isn't today a good memory.

I have realised mujhe khi aaur chalna chahiye. Aagli baar me itna lucky nhi hunga aur mummy ko shikayat chli hi jaygi 
To me ek nyi duniya ki khoj me nikala .
I didn't even like them as human being but i didn't have anywhere else to go so i was playing along.

Now so next day i just lied to them my mom told me not to sit and went to apoorv.

.
Pr mujhe ek person dikha.
Hmari class mei ek apoorv tha jo aakash mei coaching krta tha.
Kartikey aur shubhankar usse chhka chhkka krte thee aur class mei moke dhundte thee usse chakka bolkr sbko hasain.
Mujhe dekh kr bhot gussa aata tha pr mujhe apta nhi tha unhe kya bolu - ab aise bolunga hme dusro ko chidana nhi chahiye.
And i wadnt so smart that i will shame, ego-abuse  in indirect way. 
So i thought i will sit with him. IIT ki baate krenge.
(The reaosn why they both hated him was because he didn't take them seriously and they saw it as him acting oversmart and arrogant because it hurted their ego.
They have told me story of how apoorv said he willnt give sanik school exam yet he was present there and he didn't give them any explanation)

They saw me joining apoorv as ultimate betrayal. I was completely unaware of it.















I was very strict about not doing cheating. 
I used to think cheating is bad and we shouldn't do it.
I will show to arpan but there wasn't effort i just adjusted paper in a way so he would be able to see but i never spoke or activiely try it was just he happened to see.
Otherwise i was strict i willn't show to anyone. 



Pr **Vasant ritu** mein, mene ek exception ya thoda apne abhi tk bachpan see lekar Wale rule main compromise Kiya thoda pr abhi bhi mujhe me strictness thi 
Ab mei exam class me 3rd row ki 1st seat pr baitha tha aur mujhe signals 2nd row ki last seat pr send krne hote thee.
Now hmari communication lines bcho ki Jisse normally cheating hoti thi pr pr maths ke exam mei wo possible nhi tha kyuki tum maths kaise bologe aur symbolically convey kroge.
To us din wo puch rhi thi pr mei bta nhi skta tha to mene bhi give up krdiya batane pe



When mam told about me writting in her copy
She told mam that she used my pen it wasn't me, writting really don't match much 
(i did modified my writting, so it doesn't exactly match and i tried to wdo it in her don't but i was writting too fast )
She told mam that she used my pen but i didn't write.
My respect and value increased from that and i felt that i should have helped more exam



And sometimes theyll ask me to allow them to hit me so they willnt take revenge anymore and i will allow them & try to act you know its oka do what you want but they never really hit hard they were nice people 

Kartikey me tumhare saar game samjhta hun tum khudko jayda chalak samjhte hon.
**mene pucha ki mene tumhare saath kya chalaki krdi**



I was remembering how i used to race with my friends with who will finish cursive writing book first in childhood and now my 12th is about to be finished and it's not really that bad.




Coincidence escape death
Mei normally khoya khoya rhta tha aur mujhe physical world ka utna nhi dhyaan rhta tha pr ek din i had dream or something happened that made me think of chipkali on my way to washroom.
So i was looking for chipkali everywhere.
Snake was there his colour i wouldn't have even noticed normally 



Let me tell me about my dummy school JPM, so my father had friend who was director of school (maybe)
But he has multiple buisness and told father that he can make join in his school.
At first day, i went there for English ASL. Plan was i will wait there with mom, sir when he will be free will take asl.
But it was this receptionist mam went to principal who told me principal sir told that i will have to spend normal day.
Oh no i felt like dying.
I have been gloomy state for so long i am literally an empty husk.
I atleast need some time to think of dialogues to say and expression & prepare so i can do something.

Kid ask me are you here to teach?



Receptionist mam talking this way to director
She was direct, punchy, systematic, tradiosnlist type of person.
Now i don't know if director was director but my class-teacher seem to call his name with respect but mom felt like he lacked authority.
He is more friendly and smiling and agreeable type of person so i guess punchy person may walk over him.


1. Kunal told me he bought chipkali.
2. I fear and hid didn't see, acnt show my we
3. We planned to scare class girls
4. we were planning throwing laughing and whole time i acted like kya yee plastic ka khilona hee isme kon drta hai kitne bcho wali baat hai.  Aur hipocracy hai ki mene chipkali closeup dekh bhi nhi ek baar bhi nhi mujhe abhi tk kuch nhi pta hai us chipkali ka kya colour tha ya kaisi dikhti thi Jo mene dekha tha wo duur see kisi aur kee bag pr, aur wo bhi dikhta nhi
5. To jinko bhi Kunal darata mei aaisi hi tone mei baat krta (me chipkali dekh nhi skta chunga kaise)
6. I wanted to implant in his head that when he will throw at me . I will be just emotionless  & be like k*ya chutiyapa kr rhe ho* & *ya chipkali feel dunga*
7. I have to conjure courage to do all this and i got tired from all fakeeness so in end i sat down in my desk and at last bench so there won't be sneak aatack. **I can directly see Kunal seat too** *Aur mujhe andar sb ke liye bhot bura LG rha tha*
8. So Kunal was scaring this girl Khushi who used to super scared of chipkali, and i was just smiling from behind because if Kunal thought i am busy in my work, he.will throw it at em i know it. I wanted him to know i am still engaged. 
9. Aur uss akhri ladki nee hi mam see jakar shikayat krdi, 'agrim aur Kunal ..' 
10. Mene instantly bola chipkali Kunal ki hai. Mera yha pr koi dosh nhi meh yha pr khud ek victim hun. Mujhe kitni natak Krna pda.
11.  Pr Kunal nee mujhe khich liya aur khushi nee bola hm dono thee. 



9th was the most melenchonic i felt atleast till that time so just everything went in drain and i stopped that game since i just ont have much mental space ledt


















I wasn't type of person to lie. My mom taught me not to. God will punish me.

Why door was locked
Now the things was - i actually didn't like paying outside game. I think i am okay with playing game for fun we can play cricket or football and just enjoy it but i cant do this everyday and we have been playing ever since we were born. They all talk about the match and everything is that. Its so utterly annoying.
I think i will like exploration and adventure sports stuff

except few one

Act like that thing never happened

First Lo. Stroy with bois share (include cheating, bag throwing, water throwing)
Don't tell class but say i changed school and entered this new school
Now i think about just because my body devloped feeling for someone it doesn't need to grow into relationship that is not point. 
Life is life experience, breathe, see.



Kartikey said tum chalaki krte ho pr mein sb kuch samjhta hu. 



First tell arpit monkey story
Then pan masala story. And monkey chase
Monkey army ias abandoned house (bada bangla, swimming pool too, we will hid there too, )
Then stone throwing ng 
Why door was locked cause 
I don't wanted to go outside there were few games i liked mostly like
This stone throwing, we also played game pan masala, hide and seek in abandoned dm house and stuff, 
But i just couldn't tolerate systematic games like cricket, football, there is set of rules 

Didn't Like playing most of the games, no


Share story of first buisness after stone throwing, monkey throwing, panmasala throwing are done.
You can use it to o clear misunderstanding of religion


When you end story with where kartikey and shubhankar standing together talking principal tell. 
I wanted to taunt kartikey for his mind reading abilities but i didn't mujhe inke saath hi baathna hain.
Say actually i know the origin where it started that i poached shubhankar and i so chalaki with him.
Actually just normal day it was substituted period.
The two of them were talking loudly i will come say few words but i was only passive listener.
Mam nee tino ko khada kiya.
I felt little wrong ki mene thodi hi baat ki thii pr ab mam see ladayi nhi start krdunga.
Wo dono kuch time me phirse baat krne lge.
I thought maybe if i acted sad then **maybe** mam will let me sit.
**atleast apna net cast to kru**
So i opened a copy and then i wasn't reading my eyes were 45-50* i was looking but not looking and i just try to make myself cry even though i can't but i try. To think of things and stimulate my brain in order too feel sad.
In the contrast they were still taking.
I think i was lucky that it was mam, i think female has **higher sensitivity**.
If it was sir they wouldn't have care most probably, i mean my own friends were besides me but they didn't ask or care.
So i just say down and i didn't break my character but me sitting down was very unsettling for two of them so they start saying mam yee bhi thaa yee woo.
I just maintained the same expression from before and didn't said ki Mee baat nhi krr rha thaa bss unhe bolne Diya aur mam ki taraf mud gya same expression kee saath. Like you know kya faadak pd jaayga mee yha pee baithu bahar khada hu, bech pee khda gu, yaa kuch aaur **what chabges** verything willbe same.
Phir class mein kuch samay tk shaanti rhi pr phir mam nee unn dono ko bola tum dono class see baahar jaao.
**Same hi is type ki chiz do baar Hui thii**



Kartikey I said, now I knew kartikey well I thought, I expecet d him to be like I didn't do anything firm igid I will mirror same behaviour in end sir will beat us both. 
And jyada longo keep hone see punsihment ajr bast dilute ho jaygi.
Sir even if knew won't change thing cz foow is now nrolen.

I didn't expected he will **wither**



**By rubbers of different colour and scent and demonstrate using that**
We had coloured rubber, in one stroke it will leave a trail of coloured rubber trail and we will slowly collect it and rub it sidewards to turn it into thread and be careful to not break the thread



I willnt say anything to them but you can act in way of
You are so amazing. Special human being, by way you look, act, speak, smile. 
I will never say anything directly it will out of character
It helped ensuring that seeds willnt grow


**Dream**
In holtel there was option to gamble and 5star food.
whwrw sleep in hall with lot of people. I was with my family and friends and we didn't get pillow in order that restrict our ability to sleep at same spot in hall and everyone will have to sleep dispersed so what I did was when light went off and people next to us started sleeping.
I snatched and replaced their pillow in order and exchanged them with our disordered/disorganised.
Now night went on.
I wanted to go to washroom.
I went there, I also saw hotel-officials
For some reason I didn't had my pants on so I went to fetch my pants and saw that those official standing next to place where we were sleeping and there was a big machine there.
It kept track who lost how much in gambiling and who did fraud and there was number tah of people I steal pillow from





6-7yrs range 90% change but 7-8yr 10% chance
I was in middle of speaking 
I have spoken
Mujhe patthar girne ke awwaj aayi thi  
And I felt an gentle tug inside me 
Words that came out of my mouth were 
Ayush sayad tumhara paathar car pee lgg gya.
And bolne kee baad mujhe lga mene kya bol diya aur guilty feeling I have never lied, I had really strong moral compass I didn't even knew I can choose to lie.

Mam gave me pass.
I felt really dumb when I have to bring bag in the end. 
I mean I could have bought bag earlier. What was the point.
I really didnt want to be put in weird position where I don't know how to explain myself and I ran away from it.
Like I domt know how to explain they too don't know what to expect of me so I Can just act arrogantly and just say anything.
Like bag kiska hai? Mujhe kya PTA mee niche see bag lane Gaya tha?
Mujhe class mei lei Jana hai. 
Like I don't know why to say they too don't know what to expect I can say anything.



Best way to dumb down revenge tendency after fight was moral-superior stance coming from
Imagine personable(refer your friend) had fight with someone.
Now you won and imagine two scenario.
First one is you won and you and all of us are laughing at person who lost
Second one is tum jite pr ladyi kuch aaisi thii ki jaise 
Gaali kaise dedi mene tujhe kuch kaha tumne anger aaisa ladyi ki jite aur tum serious thee hm sb sayad haas rhe thee sayad nhi.

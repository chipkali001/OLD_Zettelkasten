Hero, child - Optimistic & Positive outlook
Parent, Inferior - Negative Outlook
Nemesis, Trickster - Optimistic yet still -ve due to lack of maturity
Critic, Demon - Super super pessimistic
**‘If Inferior function turn to optimism then SUBCONSIOUS USABLE’**
For INFJ, Se inferior, use Se optimistically i.e. CHANGE ENVIRONMENT FOR YOU.
**If Demon taken Care of Unconsious usable** 
Super-ego MEGA MEGA pessimistic but EXTREMLY RARE SCENRAIO some people can turn it to OPTIMISTIC (Self-Respect and others)


Ni Fi Si Ti - Are PRODUCERS
Ne Fe Se Te -Are Consumers

Fe wants Fi to remain moral
Te wants Ti to feel smart


# YING YANG PAIRS
## Perceptions

Ni - **detached from movement**, tap into umplication, conserve energy
Se- **absorbed in movement**, simplistic, act quickly, tap into sense, way to spend energy

Ne- future creation, experiment, brain storm, get out of comfort zone, **What if**, **Optimistic**
Si - treasure pass, sees memory everywhere, likes saftey, procedure, expert & traditon advice, **Realistic**
## DECISIONS
Te- group think/metric/status, Improve systems for goals
Fi- Inner feelings, morals, self, personal feelings, art to replicate emotions, understand human emotions nuance.

If you are 
High with function -Overly Optimistic, More Posbillity see
Low with function - Pessimistic, get by, 




**Te most active, more active than Se, since indulgence in sensory without much activity possible**
Ti points out some faulty logic area in Te system, Te says i am aware of it but I AM GETTING RESULTS, who cares?
Ti work too personal, may not even work for another high Ti, 
want to identify most efficient approach (may overlook human factors/boredom/work in machine like way & may work like robot for some time but can get exhausted)

# Demon/Angellic Funtions
**REMEMBER THE SAME FUNCTION CAN ALSO BE ANGELIC FUNCTION**

 -

### Demon Si or Angellic Si

It is being constrained by 'what is known to be acceptable and _**normal**_'  
Thinking of it in context of being opposite of Ni - it is my enemy. I want to move forward, change, adapt. It wants to go back, maintain, resist the new.

It's not actually incorrect to associate Si with "normality." Si is about our lived experiences and how they personally impact us. It's about your interoception and your energy levels. Si causes use to seek out harmony, peace, and balance both in the day-to-day and in the large scale. Si loves to eat and sleep and Si is key to that really pleasant feeling you get after taking a solid dump. Si is "normality."

The problem in this community, then, revolving around Si is twofold: the first is the misunderstandings surrounding Si ("It's about nostalgia" or "memory:" no) and the second is how we then associate normality not with Si users (everyone) but instead with SJs.

We all have Si, we all engage with normality, and in terms of Si-normality we are all normal (we all eat and shit and have interoception). This is not the domain of SJs; it's just that their relationship to that aspect of normality (for the record: all of the functions are "normal" and mundane) is a bit different.

So what does Si Demon look like (for those uninitiated: Si Demon is a way to describe INXJ's relationship with Introverted Sensation).

INXJs consciously reject their Si. They don't want it to be a part of them. They think they're above the eat/sleep/shit cycle, but they're not. I've seen Si Demon express aspects of itself as: self-harm, insomnia, an uncontrollable impulse to conserve things that are clearly dying (relationships especially), highly unrealistic expectations, an egotistic "I'm not your average girl" self-vision, a lack of respect for people who work their asses off while the INXJ lazes about, fucked up relationships to food, hyper-fixation on specific details of a thing (taking hours and hours of extra time to complete a job), and so on.
 -- -- -- -- -- 
At its core Demon Si says: "Si is not a part of me, and I'm glad for that!" while Si still manages to be a part of them and acts without their conscious control.
 -- -- -- -- -- 
I personally could never eat on schedule and will often go on long periods of eating same food, then suddenly develop acute aversion towards that food and switch to eating something else only to repeat this process. When I observe how Si dominant and auxiliary types do it in my family, they prefer to eat on schedule and they serve the full 3 courses of dishes with variety of food present on the table.

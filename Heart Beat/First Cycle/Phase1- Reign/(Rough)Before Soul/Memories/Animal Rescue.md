# Animal Rescue
There  was a time when we rescued a  bird but one time we failed to rescue the baby squirrel

There was a time we rescued a squirrel kids who very very very small their who skin was hairless and pink skin coloured (I didnt recognize dthem as squirrels but mom told me later) but they fell of the nest their mother was missing so we picked up a sweet box that was lying around in colony road and covered it from above so no monkey

Mom scolded me and told to put them back. The mom must be seaching for them. We had to put them back from where we bought them and we tried to put it on the highest branch of the tree along with sweets box so that squirrel mom will come. Even after 7pm when it got dark and there werent many light we stayed waiting for their mother to come but in  the end we have to go back home. At that  time we had a preposition that bats will attack  us if we stayed there becaude bat used to fly very low and we heard that if one time bat gets tick to you have to use a heated chimta to get it off.

 Next day when we came back squirrel baby and sweet box was nowhere to be found.

Introversion or Extroversion decides wheter primary funciton is introverted or extrovered
1)Primary function *decided by I/E of First letter in MBTI*
2)Secondary function
3)Complete opposite of Secondary function (Ni ←→ Se) (Ti ←→ Fe) (Ne ←→ Si) (Te←→Fi)
4)Complete opposite of Primary function (Ni ←→ Se) (Ti ←→ Fe) (Ne ←→ Si) (Te←→Fi)

**Replacing I←→ E just switch cognitive function place (Hero←→Parent) (Child ←→Inferior)**

| I   | Ni (1st) | Fe (2nd) | J   |
| --- | -------- | -------- | --- |
|     | Se (4th) | Ti (3rd) |     |

| I   | Ne (2st)  | Fi (1nd) | P   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | Si (3rd) | Te (4th)  |     |



1st develop really young
2nd junior high school ()
3rd early 20s 
4th later

1st Hero- What we are (50%)
2nd - GROWTH OPPORTUNIT (30%)
3rd - Weakness/Defensive/Comfy (5-10%)
4th - Opposite of what we are, BLINDSPOT, Whispers at our calling (5-10%)
5th - Nemisis (argumentative, annoyed in others)
6th - Critical Parent (Nagging, crticising you, you are fake)
7th - Trickster (Complete blindspot, you may blind to point to think I CAN USE THIS), Difficult to relate
8th- Demon (Repressed) (may think of it as IMAGINARY THING, not even real)

For 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th REVERSE introversion/extroversion of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th

Hero — Nemisis
Parent --- Critic
Child --- Trickster
Inferior --- Demon

Hero-Inferior
Parent-Child
Critic—Trickster
Nemesis-Demon


Fi-Te - i feel you think, you think i feel
Ne-Si - i exeperienced this things you may want to do it
Ni-Se - i like this flavour- you should have it it’s really good, i see what you are doing so i want to do that thing
Ti-Fe - You feel that way about what i think, i think this-other person has suddenly emotional reaction


**Cognitive Function Trick**
| Ego         | 1(Hero) | 2(Parent) | 3(Child) | 4(Inferior) |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Shadow      | 1*(Nemisis)  | 2*(Ciritc)       |  3*(Trickster) |  4*(Demon) |
| Subconsious | 4    |  3 | 2   |1 |
| Superego |4*| 3*|2*|1*|
(You can assume 1=4* then 4=1*  )

Maturity = Shadow Development
Happiness = Subconscious Development

Rules for function-
1. Mirror Left-Right, reverse order fxn, Switch middle function
2. Mirror Top-Bottom, keeps order reverse Inner & Outer function  
Dreaming in mirror - you have finally become free from outer and inner both.
Diagonal look - different core person
Ego interacting with it’s subconsious power in mirror
Ego seeing it’s shadow on ground
Shadow in mirror - super ego, opposite on internal
Shadow either expand or shrink - therefore outer elements reverse (introvert-extrovert judging-perceiving)

Shadow=Unconsious
Anima=Subconsious

| Ego (Conscious)| Subconscious |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Unconsious (Shadow) | Superego |

After deep and profound contemplation, i was able to come up with such a masterful & polished XYZ. It’s not just an essay, but a work of Art with deep spiritual roots.

It requires an ‘astute spiritual mind’ who is at higher realms of consiousness

It’s not something a petty mind will be able to comprehend the profundity of such an art .

Worse, it may see it as gibberish.

Oh, (what a tragedy!)/(How tragic)

It’s a PROFOUND SPIRITUAL SACRED ART.

You need a person with an astute mind, higher level of consiousness who can truly understand and appreciate the spiritual antiquity of this art. Dumb people will percieve this as giberish but it’s sacred ancient art

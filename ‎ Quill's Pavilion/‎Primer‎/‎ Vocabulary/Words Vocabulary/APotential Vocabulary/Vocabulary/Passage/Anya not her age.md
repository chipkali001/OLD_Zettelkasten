”Even with telepathy ability, Anya is probably the most normal when it comes to being a kind.”
Well abused kids tend to grow up faster. A lot of kids at this academy has been emotionally neglected abd abused, all because their parents desperately want to have great status so that they can stupidly brag.  
Remeber the entrance exam? How the one boy before our main family flubbed a qusestion, as the boy's family walked out, the father went off as though said named little boy was some random employee who didnt meet their quota.

Anya managed to get away from wherever she was around 2-3 yrs old, and was around normal.  
Poverty stuck children would definetly try to distract themselves form poverty by filling whatever little time they werent scavenging with tons of games and child-like play.

So yeah, Anya's childhood sucked (and probably would have more if she had stayed) but atleast she aint these kids who had to grow-up super fast, lest they suffer at the hands of their own damn parents

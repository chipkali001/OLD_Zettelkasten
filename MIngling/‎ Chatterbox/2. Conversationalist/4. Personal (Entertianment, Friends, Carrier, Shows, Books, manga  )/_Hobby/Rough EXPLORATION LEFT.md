What your favourite genre

Which types of tropes do you like?

I like medivial settong fantasy story where male lead is highly intelligent/ shatir/ chalak

lowborn or some mysterious person who is not that famous persona just lowborn in oyher eyes and 

Prideful or arrogant or coldprincess female lead romance.

Male lead use his cunning

I one time asked father to buy me Casio if i finsihed next to next year class8th maths book and i competed in 2-3 days. But he never completed the promise. I got angry and asked so many times. But no.

I am kind of angry. 

It should have been a good thing there child wants to learn something new and they should help it 

And i was dillegent kid, like i told i finsihed next to enxt class book in 2-3 days and studied day and night for it cuz i AHS that much dilligence.

They should have been more involved in wanting me to cultivaye myself.

But they dog have any hobby of themselves so it was expected i guess?

Which type of school was your school. Was it strict type? Or kids were out of control.

How much luck do you think you have been gifted throught life?

(Let them choose their own scale)

Rate good luck and bad luck separately.

Example there may be something which 

good luck first and later turn into bad luck and vice versa things that were bad luck at first but later turn into good luck.

So i don't want you do is suffering i went through was 3 and out come was worthy of points. 

5-3=2 good luck. Wrong

5 good luck 3 bad luck right

Good luck meter collects points seperately and bad luck meter collects points seperately.

Becoz i feel reality is complex 

There maybe things make me feel i am so blessed but at the same time i may feel why these few things only happened with me. Both can exist parrlely we don't need vector sum.

I will exain to you what definition of good luck and bad luck becoz concept on luck is very vague and definition of good luck and bad luck maynot match

Good luck - how many things/experiences/human-beings that you thought were completly out of your imaginingation 

Bad luck - events doesn't happened in a way that is supposed to happen for your reality specifically.

I am saying your reality specifically because you know there are humans in world starving, born defective, child-trafficking, so in that sense i claiming my bad luck was 10/10 will be very impudent. But i can still emotionally feel that my bad luck was 10/10 so i want to know how much suffering you feel was endowed on you which wasn't fair.

My bad luck - 7/10

My Good luck- 15/10

Why so high good luck or bad luck do you have stories to share

Please tell me. I will not share or judge.

(To piku) For me you are big reason for increasing my high good luck/ becoz of you my good luck has increased.

If you were given the opportunity to choose a few memories to carry over to your next life after rebirth, which would it be?

I will want maybe my present framework of thinking i don't need memory 

Whats your fondest memory of school or childhood? 

It's too personal that i don't want to share

Me i don't knowm. I like not to pick anything and being indecisive.

In moment when i suddenly use a word which sounds very amazing and i have never even looked up meaning of word before, and when i later go on net to check it's meaning. The way i used the word was almost perfect. It's feels good.           

There was point where it happened with me lot of time, i will write a word that is so commonly used and i have used so many times EX-Day and i will think 

WAS IT ALWAYS SPELLED THIS WAY

Let's compete pushup.

And let's set reward first The one who looses will buy pizza .Qu

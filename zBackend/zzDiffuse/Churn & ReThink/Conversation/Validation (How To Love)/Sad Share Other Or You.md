You know just talking about it feels so painful, I can't imagine you must have felt. (ACKNOWLEGE PAIN)\

(SAY OTHER PERSON IS STRONG, FOR JUST STANDING AGAINST SOMETHING LIKE THAT)

(It increases my RESPECT & VALUE for you)

It must be so heavy to carr. I really respect your endurance

In other share, I can never fullly understand

Why not want to tell? Is it sharam? Or shame? What is it? Sharam about what,

It's okay don' tell me name, age, gender.

Just tell me what change did that person made

IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME, THEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND SAY IT WITH FIRM VOICE,

Realizing the irony of situation i recalled everything
Him screaming kind of, orderging get out, standing next to me, and
EVEN I AM looking in his eyes. 
How big he considers himself to be and how weak arms and body is?

I empathized
He is teaching and i coming as please and sitting doing as i please.
He may feel boundary voilated.

**Morally That doesn’t make him right.** (*Dont cut off your sould from stories*)
I did mistake.
In beginning, I was already at seat time he called out. Was polite and i tried to neutralize, i thought this was time for? will continue and see here.
But he was rude, trying to make joke, JUST ANIMALISTIC.
Wo atleast 15-30yrs older no decent human talks to someone 15-30yr younger on first sight. That’s even below human,

Now however teachers comes - 
if i try to justify by this morally wrong. it will be seen as ULTI BAAT KAR RHE HON, BDE HAIN jayda experience hain. Yee sb bakwas. 

**i will have to play other game**
Dialogues ~~WRITE~~ tell mam

i didn’t like it but not in powerful enough state to confront (don’t say)




He can’t look past his anger.
Didn’t asked listen to m



I behaved polietly yet continue rude?
And just looking at arrogance of how he think he could send me away. just looking at his body, in normal scenario never would dare. how much delusion of power.

# 2 September

**WHAT TRANSPIRED**
Mistake My Inexucasable- there was extra class at 10:30 but i thought chemistry shifted to 10:30.
**Normally** it’s 2:15-3:40.
I thought i have arrived few minutes late.
**Sir** uncle kha ja rhe hon
Didn’t turn back went to seat.
I turned back
Sir i will just continue (i dont have intention of escalating this, and though he is angry cuz i am late)
(I paid so i have right to stay)
Didn’t budge came up to me.
Trying raising voice to get me out.
I just stood there sitting
Asked to call up people from outside to take me.
After few seconds, I went out myself.
Then an bhiya who works there ran upto me, told me to wait.
Then sir came out, asked me to give my id card.
Take it from me when you leave.

Went class and next came.
During class for some reason i felt heavy feeling like on verge of crying i couldn’t explain why.
I wasn’t hurt in any form nor scared of him calling as i’m in right now my parents may not once again stand on my side as with rudra and just shame me. probably it was that.
Disappointment of me doing everything right but them not even listening to me but instead shaming me.
While i was solving geometrical optics.
I prepared my points to speak.
- im sorry, i made a mistake
- For fun teacher bezzati
- like you started WITH UNCLE KHA JA RHE HON
- PUSHED ME INTO DEFENSIVE POSITION. 
-  didn’t have time to process
- I tried not being disruptive trying to neutralize i’ll just join wherever class is. (i paid that’s why i said) but he prolonged cuz ego hurt
My faults- Your lack of common-sense knowledge of (extra class, not class shift),(Not bell ring & time is 3:50 not 3:40)
**internally i had more points
He is 10-20-30** yrs older yet younger treat like this



Next period end.
Sir not in that staff room place
I tried asking to same bhiya.
Will come there.

Thought probably taking a dump, went to scout that region nowhere present.
Once again checked at that bhiya region which was heavily crowded.

Kid was kind of respectful.
Asked if i had done syllabus and come when i want.
Sir emotional hogye wo

Then mam asked sir and take card.
Then mam got up and i pointed oh there on that other desk my card.
Mam picked up, called sir.
Sir said to call my parents.
Mam asked mene batamezzi ki thi.
I just played the points which i prepare.
But when my voice started to crack as i was saying. I felt internal shame why is my voice cracking.
I’m not hurt in any way, nothing happened to me, i am thinking clearly , acting logically, why is my body acting up, but 






I was delusioned of mom, cuz my mom agian like with alok sir said
My kid won’t do that.
SHE knows i won’t BE MALICIOUS
SHE IS AWARE that i have Fe , therfore trust it to ocontinue to Fe



I felt really horrible whole time like i verge on crying - maybe it’s kind of trauma/ptsd from 6-7th class incident - monika mam tells i am  coering her kid into game. 
My mom dad, iddnty stood with me, nor listened. they are lying g- it’s false bkame, bbut htey just thought of it as an excuse.
**mom even swaid i bought them *shame*, mom told this in group**
My whole life till them - i was super sincere.
Did right thing. Not lie. They meant so much to me.
I felt abandoned. it was worst i have felt in my entire life till then.
Even **Ayush** told me - why mingle?
He took his side and continued talking to him. My best friend.
**I JUST FELT LIKE EVERYONE I CONSIDERED TO SO IMPORTANT TO MY LIFE has betrayed ME**
I want them to be unconditionally there wheter i’m right or wrong 
**but it seems they only do when tingles their emotion**

**What will be told**
*Do unreliable narrate let them learn your fuckups as they happen*
1. Start with misundertanding (unreliable narrator) class 2-3:30 shifted to 10 morning. (don’t tell which teacher was taking it, just random class shigt)
2. I got late arrived 2nd period already start 3:40 around, door close, everyone sitting, bag ke saath realise - acctually not extra class but yee period lga.
3. I am few minutes late, hesistant about getting in, but fuck
4. Sir call when midway, but i ignore and just make way
5. Sir ask me to get ouot & i was like (okay i’m few minutes late but you aren’t going to kick me out)
6. Says class already middle
7.  I try to be like - will contimue from where 
8. REALISES 1st period going on
9. but this is already time for 2nd period, baki classes settled thi
10. He is being too rude, probably accustromed to pushing kids around. PRIDE
So classes 2 to 8:30.
okay that day our 1st class of IJC sir got shifted in morning 10 something. going for 90min time waste.
Now 2-3:30 won’t happen cuz it happen in morning.
But by the time, everyone was sitting quitely and everyhone studying, settled in seats, thoruhgt coaching, no moments. I thought fuck
**I AM LATE**
(Edit the forward story to make it align to narrative that you believed and REALISING.
Oh he is teacher supposed to teach first & his class has spent whole break teaching.
NOW HOW CAN I EXPLAIN - i don’t know name of this teacher, nor i know subject which this class is, nor i know 3:40 pe class end hoti hain - 3:50 pe end hoti hain)
**Also don’t tell you only told receptionist mam and writting points in compy.
MERGE BOTH TOGETHER**
Probably used to kids being complacent. I’m not playing wiht oyu.
(tell realistion of 
1. self-stupidity- & bina baat ke mene ek teacher see dushmani kr li
2. MADE ENEMY - sir wounded pride SO it can’t like okay baith kr POV smjhenge- )
3. Pay Karmic Debt
4. So end mei jb mere wapas card lene ki baat aayi, sir thee nhi,  wo database mein see mere parents ka number nikal rhe thee
5. it’s **common** for teachers **to** bezzati  **kids** ko point krke in **front of whole class** **mzze(1)*** lene ke liye, aur class ko entertaining **(2)** bnane ke liye. 
6. I was silent whole time mene sir see kuch nhi bola, aap class mein kisi see puch lo (skip mam asking you sir said you talked back, just ) (don’t say went inito defensive mode makes you sound weak) (don’t say UNCLE Kha jaa rhe hon quoting )
7. Okay jaao, I left



I walled little sir called out to me.
Now you know teacher mazak krte hain, to mein bss jaakar piche jha seat mili wha pr gya.
***Sir ne ab piche see mujhe class see bahar jane ko bola, class ke bich mein aa rhe hon*** 
I spoke i will try to continue from where they are teaching (***I have paid, i won’t be sent back cuz i am few minutes late***)
Now sir again angry “His voice reflected anger and was saying **can’t come in whenever you like** blah blah”
i realize that chemistry is still going, next isn’t started.
**but sirs fault**, i have arrived at right time for next period. 
I’m doing right thing. I am not moving.
**Sir by now next to my seat, angry full, asking me to get out,**
I can feel he wanted to pull me out.
**But i am clearly many times stronger than him** (Don’t say height but just strength)
IT WAS SATISFYING cuz maybe just he used to kids being intimidated & his ego is hurt, cuz he is now appearing so childish
**Unme dm nh i hila paayenge** kcuh minute baad wo bolte hain bahar seein bula kr laao.
i SIGH get up, leave.
(**don’t say ypu felt llike they went to call security guard** ***CRINGE***)
Then an bhiya who works there ran upto me, told me to wait.
Then sir came out, asked me to give my id card.
Take it from me when you leave.
*I sat solve Geometrical optics, now i* ***HAVe TO PREPARE MY POINTS***
Higher up probably- suspend for **week** & call at home. 
I’m clearly at fault cuz **lack of common sense won’t make sense** (3 faults are)
- Extra class pta nhi thta hoti hain, mtlb 4 classes ho rhi hain, to class shift hui hogi
- Mujhe nhi pta konse naam ke teacher kya pdhate hai, aur mein kiss class mein ja rha hun
- Slot doesn’t start from 3:40 but 3:50
**My fault from their POV** - it wasn’t 3:40 yet
(*my phone number wrong so maybe not ring*)
(ABOVE WILL CREATE SENSE OF OF. BEETA TU TO GYA in listeners mind, but comes plot twisth)
My points
1) (Humble) I’m sorry. it’s my fault i thought 2nd period began. 
2) You know it’s **common** for teachers **to** bezzati  **kids** ko point krke in **front of whole class** **mzze(1)*** lene ke liye, aur class ko entertaining **(2)** bnane ke liye.
3) Like mujhe ghuste hin sir ne bola tha -**uncle kha jaa rhe hon**
4) My BODY went into **DEFENSIVE MODE**, didn’t me (*i was silent whole time*)
5) I tried to neutralize and politely say - I will try to continue from where class is going **cuz i don’t want to create more disturbance**
**ACCUSATORY** ROLE can’t do **Have to play poor CUZ they willn’t have gut to call my parents or suspend me.**
CUZ I WILL HAVE TO BE DIRECT, RUDE and they willn’t listen to my points and belike ULTA JAWAB DETE HON, bade hain RESPECT KRO. And with t hat ttype of story **EVEN MY mom dad won’t stand with me**
I guess emotional fluff is more listened to pure logic
1)  sir was rude from beginning
2)  i dont find it respectable behavior talking to someone10-20-30yrs younger like that 
THEY WILLN’T HAVE SPINE TO CALL MY PARENTS IN FRONT OF ME. I WAS SURE they will get decimated.
**us samay wh obhi sucide wala kuch din phele hua tha, 2 months tk no tesdt6**

My voice even cracked little while was telling of atrocities committed 


# 6 SEPTEMBER
well, today inorganic teacher, called me out for doing my work.
My chemistry with Chemistry teachers is bit awry.

I am doing myself, come see.
What didn’t allowed me to come with good refute was fact 
I slowly said i am doing good in tests.

Though I realize what i was lacking - WHY did i felt so disconnected - Why i felt like my MEANING THREAD has been severed.
I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM SHAME, ACCOUNTABILITY - LYING!!!
That’s why I have shutdown everyone.


# Confrontation
I am not disturbing, 
**aap mujhe nhi btaoge**
I don’t want to be disrespectful.
i don’t have any oblligation to anwser. 
**i don’t want advice from you.**
Only go when someone comes to take you. 
Say them don’t touch me.


**There’s reason but that’not the point, **

I want to COMPLAIN TEACHER who should i talk TO. 
Speech of {Open-Camera & Stuff plotted 
Accusation- Make scene - hve to go to same class.
*NOT FIRST TIME has happened to me 2times before*
==THEME - DISTURB NOONE ALONE - PUBLIC HUMILTN & 
Pain-SameClassGo  AFTER HIM SAYING, I FELT SO MUCH SHAME GOING back to class==
**Sir should i go back to class, or go home. SIR SENT ME OUT THAT I CAN’T khud see baithkr solve**
come back to class {ULTIMATE DISRESPECT}
If i go alone, wo phir see koi line maarenge.

Maybe giggle. THEN SAY **I AM RECORDING**


Easy for him, apne see 20-30yr old younger person pickup, and make rest of the kids laugh at them. Whatever good he gets out of doing that.

*This isn’t an environment to talk about my preprations.*
**i don’t want advice from you.**
And i am angry at my self that i tried to explain myself to you last time. (he won’t remember probablySD
**I AM TRYING NOT BE RESPECTFUL.**
*CROSSES LINE AGAIN*
**Aap bchi ki tarah behave krna bnd kroge ki mujhpe dhyaan kyu nhi de rhe. AUR BAAT KRNE me interested hoge tb baat hogi**
I’m ashamed. Pichli baar ek chappri ko explain krne ki koshis kri, bhot chutiya move tha.
**I DON’T HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU. You can’t appreciate i am SINCERLY doing my own work.**

# CONFRONT EXPLAIN
**I WILL NOT EXPLAIN**
YOU CAN Open Camera.
You can see - I came around 2:00, sat there not even once talked to anyone. NOT today LOOK at anyday you’ll see me talking laughing.
I’m silently Sitting there and studying.
*Don’t tell me* - He is doing this for me **cares for future**
Unke liye class mein bcho ki khili udana aasan hain.
**He doesn’t he to go and sit in same class for rest year**
Last time he didn’t do anything to help me - He was interested would have asked/care about what’s my prepration, my backlog, my level, routine, my marks- he wasn’t interested in them.
If you want to dismiss my words by words saying **i am rude/talkl-back** you can
WOULDNnn’t understand 
**human** who does this to someone 20-30yr old younger than him desrve **respect**.
I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE FOR ANYTHING. 






**Internal thoughts**
1. Angry at my stupidity, that i tried to explain myself.
2. I am not **takla** joker like you, discuss privately. (You’ll FALL TO HIS LEVEL BY saying this.)
3. Apne see **20yr-30yr** younger bacho ka **class ke samne scene bnake** mze lene ke liye.
4. Wheter i know anything or not DOESN’T MATTER
5. FOR MY FAMILY, mom who had endured so much unfairness. I CAN’T BOW HEAD
6. DON’T GIVE ID CARD AGAIN. Be rigid - DON’T TOUCH ME.

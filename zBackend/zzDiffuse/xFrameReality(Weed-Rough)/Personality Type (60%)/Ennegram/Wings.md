### **Enneagram 1 Wings**
As an Enneagram 1w2, you are more extroverted but know not to push your own boundaries. However, a 1w9 is more introverted and detached, preferring their own company.

Ones with a two wing try to simultaneously accomplish too many things, while ones with a nine wing are more laid back and often procrastinate.

Enneagram ones with a two wing have a rapid speech, and their teaching can quickly transition to preaching, while ones with a nine wing take their time to think before they speak to avoid saying something morally wrong.

Ones are good at maintaining relationships; with a two wing, it’s because they’re more caring, but with a nine wing, it’s because they’re more understanding.

### **Enneagram 2 Wings**

While those with the first wing type are introverted, others influenced by the third wing are extroverts and more people-oriented. Enneagram 2w1s are typically quiet and reserved, but twos with a three wing can be bold and strong communicators. The first wing helps type twos focus on their work, and three wings cause them to be more energetic and less focused.

An Enneagram 2w1 has a moral obligation to bring good into the world and make a change, while an Enneagram 2w3 is obligated to be the life of the party to attract as many friends as possible. A type two with a one wing is more in tune with the gut center, which powers instinct, but a type two with a three wing has a strong connection to the heart center, which powers feelings.

#### [2w1](https://enneagramgift.com/2w1-enneagram-type-two-wing-one/)

An enneagram 2w1 is inclined to help people but is more concerned with providing the proper help that meshes with your morals.

### **Enneagram 3 Wings**

As a type three with a four wing, you are more sensitive and in tune with your emotions. However, a type three with a two wing ignores their feelings more to focus on helping others and maintaining their image. Threes with a four wing care more about being authentic, while threes with a two wing willingly adapt to who others want/need them to be.

Enneagram threes desire to be admired and accepted, but with a 3w4, it’s for their eccentric style and creativity. With a 3w2, on the other hand, it’s for the hard work they put into everything they do. Threes with a four wing like to keep to themselves or spend time strictly with family and close friends, while threes with a two wing are very social and want to surround themselves with many people.

#### [3w2](https://enneagramgift.com/3w2-enneagram-type-three-wing-two/)

Enneagram 3w2s are charming and persistent, making excellent entertainers or salespeople. They crave attention from the people around them, but they can get angry or aggressive if they don’t receive it. Though they want to be recognized for their achievements, they still help others.

#### [3w4](https://enneagramgift.com/3w4-enneagram-type-three-wing-four/)

An enneagram 3w4 cares more about staying authentic to yourself than a 3w2. This can feel confusing to them because their dominant type is more of a social chameleon, while your wing type values being seen as unique. They may pretend to be someone for a crowd but feel conflicted because they know it is not authentic.

### **Enneagram 4 Wings**
As a type four with a five wing, you are more repressive with your emotions and don’t feel entitled to vent to others. However, a type four with a three wing isn’t afraid to discuss their hardships with others. Fours with a five wing don’t want to be the center of attention and prefer their own company, while fours with a three wing thrive when they are in the spotlight.

Enneagram fours both desire to be recognized; for a 4w5, they want to be admired for their intelligence and individuality, but a 4w3 wants to be seen as unique and the best. Fours with a five wing have more eccentric and nonconforming tastes, while fours with a three wing like elegant and classy styles are more socially acceptable.
[4w3](https://enneagramgift.com/4w3-enneagram-type-4-wing-3/)

A 4w3 wants to be unique and the best because they have competitive energy. Because of the three wing’s influence to be image-conscious, they can be more aware of dialing back their emotional intensity than a 4w5. Also, they want to be different but socially accepted.

[4w5](https://enneagramgift.com/4w5-enneagram-type-4-wing-5/)

4w5s are more introverted. They have unique artistic interests because they are attracted to the avant-garde and eccentric. They value being different from others but have less need to be noticed than a 4w3.

### **Enneagram 5 Wings**
As a five wing six, you feel comforted when getting to know others but still know your limits and when you need time to yourself. However, a type five with a four wing is more inclined to isolate themselves. Fives with a six wing mainly focus their studies on subjects they already know to better their knowledge, while those with a four wing want to learn about the world’s purpose.

Enneagram fives both desire to learn more and be of help, but a 5w6 studies because they want to help improve the world with better working methods, and a 5w4 uses their knowledge and understanding of the world to invent and be helpful to others. Fives with a six wing are more loyal, while fives with a four wing are more driven to be authentic.

[5w4](https://enneagramgift.com/5w4-enneagram-5-wing-4/)

An enneagram 5w4 is more sensitive. Sometimes they can come off as more self-absorbed. They are more independent as both type fives and fours do not mind being alone. They have creative and eccentric personalities and are often drawn to the unusual.

[5w6](https://enneagramgift.com/5w6-enneagram-5-wing-6/)

An enneagram 5w6 tends to be more anxious and cautious, influenced by both types. However, they often have a more social life than the 5w4 and may find it easier to be loyal to people they care for deeply. They are aware of their fears, so they surround themselves with people. A 5w6 can also sometimes come off as socially awkward.

### **Enneagram 6 Wings**

However, a type six with a five wing prefers sticking to small groups of people with the same interests and may withdraw more. Sixes with a seven wing are more relaxed, while sixes with a five wing can be timider.

Enneagram sixes desire to be protected and supported; however, a 6w7 will exercise this longing by caring for and encouraging their peers, and a 6w5 by defending themself and the underdogs.

[6w5](https://enneagramgift.com/6w5-enneagram-6-wing-5/)

[6w7](https://enneagramgift.com/6w7-enneagram-6-wing-7)

An enneagram 6w7 can be playful and entertaining. They are much more outgoing and adventurous for a dominant type six but not as risky as a dominant type seven. Since sixes often feel anxious, they always have a backup plan if their adventures go wrong.

### **Enneagram 7 Wings**
As a seven wing eight, you can get reckless because you drop projects before completing them to experience fun activities. However, a type seven with a six wing is committed to their word and will finish projects. Sevens with an eight wing don’t like being controlled by others or schedules, while sevens with an eight wing are loyal in everything they do.

Sevens with an eight wing will share their opinions without worrying about how others will see them, while sevens with a six wing are sensitive to how others think of them.
[7w6](https://enneagramgift.com/7w6-enneagram-7-wing-6/)

An enneagram 7w6 is more settled than rambunctious. They take more time to work on projects before moving on, so their pace is slower than a typical type seven. They may have an easier time committing to relationships than a 7w8.

[7w8](https://enneagramgift.com/7w8-enneagram-type-seven-wing-eight/)

A 7w8 can appear reckless because of their quick pace and competitive, bold attitude. When expressing their ideas, they can be assertive and even get aggressive when others disagree. The seven wing can help a type eight prioritize having fun over gaining power.

### **Enneagram 8 Wings**
As an eight wing nine, you are more reserved and antisocial. However, a type eight with a seven wing is super energetic and social, often surrounding themselves with people. Eights with a nine wing are great at negotiating most things business or not, while eights with a seven wing have a more entrepreneurial approach.

Nines with a one wing are more reserved in expressing their thoughts in social settings, while nines with an eight wing can be blunt about their beliefs.

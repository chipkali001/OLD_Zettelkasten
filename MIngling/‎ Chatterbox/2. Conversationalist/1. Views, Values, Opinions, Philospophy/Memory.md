Memory i think first your concept of memory and mine concept of memory are different.
For me memory is a part of an machine which i use to do my bidding
and i think most people are just locked by limiting belief which is created out of crying and envy?
1) Memorizing is painful and not fun like understanding something which is quick and kind of like instant gratification. So obviously people will cry and whine
2) This may even create envy of those who did it easily which is normal, thats why the yget pleasuyre out of degrading memory. 
3) But they themselves lack understanding of what it means to understand.
Memory is tool and very very very crucial chain for intution & creativity.

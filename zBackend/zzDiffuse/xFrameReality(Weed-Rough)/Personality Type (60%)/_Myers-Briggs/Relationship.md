From INFJ perspective commitment is Si Demon
& bit difficult for ESTP because it’s Ni inferior.
Due to attention hole - they choose to rely on lot of people so they dont burn out that one person, 
Things wearing out stress ESTP & INFJ, as they know they have tendency to burn out people.
Play safe by multiple sources of attention so no risk of wearing people out.
That’s why SJs are typically chosen by them cuz they are always the last man standing & can bear the wear, give them attention & not wear out.
Se in top function can give them attention they need and not wear out
In relaity they arent chasing volume of people but people who willnt wear out.
If they had their way, their idealistic nature will be super monogamous.
But polygamory/polygamy/serial-monogamy is defense mechanism, 
they are afraid of connecting to wrong person, who will wear out.
It’s incumbent upon you as partner you arent being worn out by them & show them you arent bored & continue to include them in thing. You just have to prove to them - you aren’t wearing out by them.
They have ability to go in their own world, imagine differnet scenario & treat sex as just sex CAUSE they dpnt fall in love.

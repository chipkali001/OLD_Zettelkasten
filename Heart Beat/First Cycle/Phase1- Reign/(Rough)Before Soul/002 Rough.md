Devrath was one of best in school in taewkowndo and went to internationa lcomeption in inodnesia.
But that made him terrible fighter in my view.

First he kicked a lot? When that wasnt the most efficeint or best thing to do in situation.
Second lacked tactics.
Me feighning i am trying to kick, or catch his kick, or i am in defense. then deliberately talking kick @ angle he didnt ewxpect me to take, and i will take the kick as it is & just suprise to grab his neck, and i had more wider upper frmae, so i can easily from there make his neck beind using my whoel body weight and ....

Or me pretending to punch, then kicking last moment
Either themselves croutch down if i hit knee even witrh superl ittle force, 
and if hjit lweg then shoched enought htat i can grab neck



My mom tells me, that when i was child and father wil bring home some drawing book. i would always make it my goal to finish it one go. i would do nothing but draw draw, by night my fingers hands and little fingers will be tired, squeezed & hurting & so i will get frustated & cry but stilln't stop doing the drawing until i ifnish book. And father would always bring lot of book & seeing so many books will worry but, but my mind wont be peace until i did it all. and i will push myself like that everyday, so mom ahd to hide books from me. IS THIS Ni?

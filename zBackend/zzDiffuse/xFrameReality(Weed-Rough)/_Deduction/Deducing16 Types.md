70% Tradition
30% Intellectual & Idealist

You can understand someone’s nature immediately & best adjust self to get close. SO YOU AN UNDERSTAND NURTURE (Colours, experiences, etc) but nurture changes day to day - nature doesn’t. IT’S KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE.

**P (Experiencer)**
More Broad, Less depth
Spontaneous
Jump from thing(hobby/person) to thing(hobby/person)’
Answer still out there even if they alread yhave 100 answers
Keep looking and Gather more and more
DON’T WANT TO BE LIMITED
P see the world was place where they are constantly being restricted and they want to break free of that

**J (STRICTER)**
IJ locked, rigid, narrow, EJ little less narrower
More Depth, less Broad
Wants ducks lined up
They cast wide net
Stick to known
RESTRICT WHAT THEY TAKE IN
THEY DONT want gather more or know more they want too find NEW in THE OLD
Find new in old
J see world as place where constnat stuff thrown at them and they are drying to distill down a very narrow path that they can go over same things over and over again.

Every humans have sensing and intution, it isn’t like sensors lack intution. 
**S** 
What visible in contrecete world
What facts they can point to, they arent looking for underlying pattersn and understand meaning
Details>Pattern
**N**
look at how things will unfold, intersting in pattern, willing to skim over and not care about events exactly, just how does things connect together.
Pattern>Details

**NP** explore gather pattern & meaning, keep branching out, explore more, i have to find out how these things are related INVERTED FUNNEL
**SP** experiencing things and gather fact
**SJ** limit things & new information and organise.
**NJ** seeing abstract and trying to limit & go over same things and against.  FUNNEL LiKE




# Organisers EXXJ: Let’s get shit done
**Changing environment**
ENTJ ESTJ - Proven Logical (Management, Administration)  
ENFJ ESFL - Social to make change (Uses people and shared feeling & experience to change) 
*PROACTICVE APPROACH*
CAN BECOME CONTROL FREAKS
Lets work together
Incline towards leading without thinking (needn’t be good leader)
Like to assemble or step into team so they can leverage 
Organise and Sort People
Push other people to do things
Fuel that Fe & Te work off is other people controbuting (ideas & values)
# EXPLORERS EXXP: Let’s explore different things
PHYSICAL EXPLORE *ESTP ESFP* - Jump off clips, sesnory, 
Intellectual EXPLORE *ENTP ENFP* metaphysical - science, art, writting, speech
Grabbing New things
1. Trying to break box, Uncovering, shine light on dark, looking under rock
2. Communication style - Thow stuff (they collected) unorganised. Here’s what i found when i was exploring.. THEY ARE JUST THROWING STUFF AT YOU, you can organise it however you want.
3. Oriented towards taking in MORE & MORE
# ARCHITECT IXXJ: I need stability
**Change to suit their needs in service to something else**
Dont get drunk of control need like EXXJ
SEE THROUGH MENTAL SCHEMA
Goal=Fulfill mental blueprint
*ISTJ ISFJ* - blueprint using past experience change, tried and true methods follow, follow customs and traditions
*INTJ INFJ* - Ni decides blueprint may or may not have basis on reality
1. Good at keeping things running/wheel turnings.
2. About organisation, system, making things efficient, organisng what EJs doing and what EPs found, make things flow smooth
3. Always trying to be teaching and make teachable movement, 
4. Communication - always giving structure to make a point
5. Good at mediating, seeing both side, seeing different perspective
# ABSORBERS IxxP: Let me do my own thing
May look similar to EXXPs Explorers,
but EXXP explore for sake of exploring collecting COOL STUFF whearas IXXP on internal PEROSNAL basis, they are self-absorbed.
They are extremly judgmental inside despite their passive outside
*INTP ISTP* - explore to appease sene of reasoning,  Ti creates internal framework of knowledge, learn best on their own, understand things for their own sake.
DONT INSULT HIS INTELLIGENCE
*INFP ISFP* - explore for personal values bought by Fi (Introverted Feeling)' DONT ATTACK HIS VALUE'
Doing things way they want to
Doing in a way they want to, What’s most important to them
**MOST SELF-FOCUSED**

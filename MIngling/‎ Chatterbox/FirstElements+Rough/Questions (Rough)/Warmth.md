Ugh, ab mere papa ka transfer hota rhta hain 

To mein 2-3 jagah rha hun.

Phele to mei paida hone kee 

Sayad 1 saal tak 

Ek jagah sayad puranpur naam tha mujhe exactly nhi pta mei bhi naam ko lekar confuse hu. Pr mei bhot chota tha to meri koi memories so that place existing or not existing doens't matter.

Then second place of baghpat, it's an Delhi ncr region ,  

i grew up there and remain till there till 8th, 

It was not an City, it was not a village, 

it was an evolved village, 

Or it was maybe little rural town,

It was on edge of haryana and Delhi.

And i used to go to my school in haryana so it was around 25km,

Aur mujhe yaad hai meri colony mei bhot saare peacock thee aur jb subhe mummy forcefully walk pr lekar jasthi to wo sb naach rhe hote thee,

It was a beautiful place .

Phir 9-13th (imply drop ) (conversation hook) 

Bareilly.

Even though i say bareilly it's not really right cuz my home was 20 km away from Bareilly just Bareilly was the closest city.

I lived in sugar mill colony. There s sugar mill where my father worked and adjacent to it is the colony / residential area.

It was a place in middle of fields. 

The whole colon is infested with monkey, you will see money everywhere.

There are so so many monkey 

Mujhe to kbhi kbhi lgta hai kei mujhe wha pr baithkr bandar ki tiktok bana chahiye tha. 

And the highway that goes in front of colony leads to nanital, sometimes you can see the mountains from there, if dust is cleared by riwn or something otherwise visible nhi hota.

Aur aab Mai iss zoo Mai rah rha hun

Actually it's complicated, my father has a job that keeps on having transfers and govt gives home as product of job, do actually that home i came from isn't my home anymore because father got transferred and i have never seen the new place so i don't know if i can call it my home? 

So i guess this zoo is home.

(Sounds confused no good, maybe good to say to a bro  but maybe or maynot piku)

Moment/Phase in childhood when you were really happy?

Moment/Phase in childhood when you were really sad

When you think about 

Nursery LKG UKG 1st 2nd class 

What memories come to your mind? OR YOUR MOM DAD TOLD YOU YOUR STORY

a)I also have memory of feeling disheartened when i went up in class(nursery to lkg or lkg to ukg) and there was still those monsters on walls.

b) In nursery, lkg, maybe ukg there were animals on walls i usd to fear them, I also have memory of feeling disheartened when i went up in class and there was still those monsters on walls. I thought we would have escaped

c) My mom told me I used to fear stuffed toys as a child. If mom kept a stuffed bear on the door then I would not go near that.

I remember i had a blue plastic chair, it sayad had dotted design of parrot, i cant remember. So i feel down backwards and hit my head, it was really painful. So i thought i fell now, i feel few days ago too and if i will keep falling my entire life it will be so painful

  One of the fondest memories that comes to my mind is I had a friend Abhay I made in lkg, ukg, 1st class range. I remember the three( me, ayush, abhay) of us were circling around in class throwing water at each other. Running in whole class. No teacher scolded us. Abhay was great friend but he got transferred to differnt section

I feared getting separate from ayush when next class comes and section changed 

Outside ayush home, together doing our cursive/beautiful writing copy, we will compete who will finish the copy first, so we were outside his house, it was getting dark, mosquito were biting us and we were doing cursive writing. I was really happy.

I was very proud i am in A section, becoz A, A=First. Section of lot of kids get shuffled every year but mine remained A till 4th class.

In childhood dadaji will buy me crax from the shop which was on otherside of highway that was just outside entry of colony. I wasn’t allowed to cross that but dadji will take me with him to shop.

In crax, there was ring and different flavoured, also you can put ring on fingers, and thre used to be gift toy inside it, i used to buy it for the gift toy.

When holi comes there will be holi gift toy.

So coming back to story, it was birthday and my grandfather handed me 4-5 crax packet while i was heading to school.

I was overjoyed by fit. However when i came back to class after playing in ground. I couldn’t find, i felt bad lost gift, looked around in bag again again again, ground looked, then came home disheartened.

Dada asked me kya mila dikhao,

I felt guilty but i lied and i dont know what i said but i manage to keep secret that i lost gift. I felt that he will feel bad if he learned that i lost gift, even though gifted me right up in early moring. 

Dadi used to wake around maybe 3 or 4 or 5, I will sleep with her and when she wakes up she will yearn a sweater. I will give sweater design to her,

I will also teach her a, b, c, d.. Give daily assignment, CHECK PROGRESS

I was really angry when i got drawing book, instead of a racing

There was period i was fond of racing car.

There was point which came in 1st class around a switch flippedin me and i start to romanticize everything. Mom, Dad, Ayush. I rember i was giving speech to ayush why should we be have gratitutde towards mom dad for giving us chance, taking care of us, supporting us. I remember how enlightened, profound, morally superior human cuz i discovered something so nice everyone takes for granted. 

Romanticisation burst also have altruism burst in me happened around same time, monitors used to stand and look at kids who violated line, they will pull them out and the kids who did that will have to stand there for long till everyone in line has left. I very strongly used to feel that i should ask bhiya let them go and let me stand in their place. I never gathered enough courage to do that cause i was really shut off and couldn’t talk to strangers. 

Becoming monitor by being honest (influened by moral books & altruism stage) and regretting it(ise school memory docs story)

I GOT INJURY IN FACE WHE NI WAS CHILD. I WOULDN'T STOP CRYING. SO THEY TOOK ME TO SHOP TO BUY ME SOMETHING TOO STOP ME FROM CRYING. I ASKED MOM TO BUY ME DUSRA  MUHH FOR ME (FACE). I WAS INSPIRED FROM WATCHING GANESH JI THAT WAS THE SOURCE THAT YOU CAN REPLACE YOUR HEAD, 

Class 3rd 4th 5th

fondest 

BOasting to my friend VEER that i filled one copy in 1 days only ( i studied so hard, i am so great!) Actually what i did was, it was new copy, in beginning i used to write in very nice good handwriting and with time it will worsen then 

Remeber i was doing to show off to my friends how hard i work such that filled a copy in one day.

So i will cheat little start using 3-4 lines to write instead of writing between one line.

2) Pen i loved expensive my mother father didnt bought me expensive pen saying i will lose it in class, i used to feel little jealous of people with expensive pen but on exams i used to get chance to buy 30rs pen so one of the pen which i consider my lucky pen went missing. 

I searched desparetly couldn’t find it.

I was so worried for so many days. 

I looked around in house.

I looked in nook, cranny of class.

I try to look daily 

And i was really disappointed and sad

Few weeks later i ayush told me uday stole it and they were about to get caught so they threw it outside the window.

I was so angry and hurt. Ayush was supposed to be my friend, he allowed all this to transpire and went along with the flow of the group. Our distance was growing. 

Twotimes in school, pen stolen, my bag had pen, so i went down to get bottle pretend and stuff it in bag of person whom i knew was the one who steals (intuition) and when later bag got check he was caught,

Second time there wasnt enough time or space to act with secrecy so i put the pen in bottle bag of kid behind me.

I learn to understand word problem by reading instead of rote memorization

I asked my friend to make, pen ink pull behind, LAUNCH! 

I had a friend Aniket, he was arrogant and egotistical. He was fan of tiger shroff and will tells me that he is the next great superhero.

My friend aniket told me that he has some type of kit using which you can make cars. He said it’s expensive bring compensation.

I gave him lots of lots of my crax toys, my pens, my pencil and he scammed me, he only bought some weird tire axle.  

EITHER THERE WILL BE COMPUTER OR TV TIME. I WAS SAD ANGRY

This is all perception game.
Most people lack depth to detect depth SO you can play perception game and win.
Tag and label matter lot in this gane

They will impose image on me SO **LET ME CHOOSE**, let me **be the ONE TO CHOOSE THAT IMAGE FOR THEM**.
I will USE IMAGE AS FRONT PAGE & Reveal other pages too, TEHY ARE NARROW-MINDED all they will see and notice is FIRST-IMPRESSION . It’s okay.  (Like take Mrinal  vids - JUST IMAGE PROJECT).

USE - **REGAL, ALOOF AURA Normally** &  Switch to **PLAYFUL** the ENERGY DIFFERENCE works nice. With friends/potential-friends **BUBBLY** will help. but BUBBLY not with fem. 

Dont get STUPIDLY ATTACHED with questioner I WILL DECIDE WHAT I WANT TO SAY, HOW I WANT TO SAY. if you think you have to think/morph answer to a question turn silent into inquisition mode then answer IT’S ABOUT YOU.


YOU DONT NEED TO BE FUNNY. You have to make them feel FUNNY, MAKE THEM PLAYFUL, MAKE THEM FEEL NAUGHTY MISCHEVIOUS. I WILL PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE **ESTP** You’re a charlatan. You make them feel naughty and mischevious that will do job.
Like If they talk about miaonise oh khalifness, make them feel they are naughty and dirty.
1. (Set Mood)Bring them in naughty mood through smile & mischevious 
2. (ATTACK) Namaste repeat for few times enocounter —>Hello /Ram-Ram/Radhe-Radhe/ (oh i didnt knew hello sounded so cheasy)
With piku you can make hello joke that - Mujhe nhi pta tha hello itna chessy ho skta hain
Sir bs kuch krke zindgi kt rhi hai assignment solve krke


IT’S SO EASY TO DISCREDIT PEOPLE OF THEIR HAPPINESS PLEASE DONT DO IT, DONT DO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE BEING HURT.
INSTEAD OF CALLING OTHER PERSON WITH DEROGATORY TERMS instead just SAY - It looks like our IDEAL of WHAT __ Is doesnt match. According to me _ _ _ _ _ _ so we should maintain distance.. FIND OTHER PERSON WHO WILL ACCEPT YOU,



I LIKE DARK CLOTHES

I don't need to run from reality and the reason why i didn't connect because i DIDN'T HAVE A GARDEN

  

I have to build a garden.

To groom people 

And also understand and pay attention to their life as friend you need to be just Lil bit interested and value what they value.

  

Talking behind back - i didnt like.
Him telling my stories to him and using them casually felt wrong.
I was disappointed in him and after few weeks
In front of him - i should mention maybe he will feel shame and correct his behaviour atleast not share with me.


**Garden part**- learned mbti as part of my novel wanting to create
You can talk to them about it like you used to talk about your game some mechanics with deveath, saransh bhiya, daksh
I.e hyperfocusing on one aspect that seems to tingle their imaginatin

Ex- backbencher? Pika? 
It's complicated, play in vaguries wrap it around memories you have. 
I felt my iq rereduxed to 1/10 around human. Now I realised.
I was using wrong intelligence.

People like weird things but it's offputting when you see someone have great energy and enthusiasm about topic you don't give shite about 

**Feel ayi** -Mam/sir xyz ko feel aarhi hain


Meet again
1. Namaste 
2. Tie string to past, make it as f you aren't meeting again but it same conversation before
3. Say like "pichi baar.... " Then connect it to what happened in their life and your life "

  You'll become akward if you think about what words to not use or how not to say. Use Se Max and trust it.

Don't ask/push people with inferior feeling about their feeling.

Sit listen/ UNDERSTAND TRY/ Reflect together/ discussion about passion of other even with self not familar

Uplift/Compliment/show-interest in achievements/projects/milestone person is invested/compassionate-about/cares-for-but-may/maynot-show-it.

Together do sensory stuff/ go to place they like.

To bait in Si/Ni User 
Tell bloodline shrewdly like 
I have forgotten his% but he got 100% in maths without never having a good teacher, living poorly in a time hwne 80% was really big thing she to hardness and strict checking 



Shutt off Ti Ni and full engage Se..if your Se is fully engage you wont speak wrong pronunciation, or sound akward sttutery, allow god to guide you can naturally correct yourself or add points later TRUST Se you have good enough data in our brain for you to say the right thing Activate Se aspirational.
Your Te trickster causes others to interpret u wrong way.
YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL for how your each word would/can be misinterpreted.
Like JPM, kartikey, E.R. doctor 


By saying what u are going to do. You can do it without facing the consequences.
Mujhe tumhare gaaal khichne kaa man krr rha hein. 
Pause just little 
Then go ahead and squeeze cheek lightly 
If you see green lights
Then suurze little tighter make them a bird with lips face 
Then slap little
Tum hasogi to mujhe aaur khichne kaa Maan krega


Remember each and every detail about that human being, don't take not even single thing lightly. You have habit of ignoring word and not even properly listening to likes and dislikes that person tells you they have. 

**Yes you are special I can see it. make human u talk to feel specia don't tell show eminate that aura of looking at them with admiration.**
(This really freatly helps to build rapport 
Like I said to one person I don't see this level of English in normal homosapiens do you read?
Yes a lot they said)


From where did you learn ___?
How did you got the idea to talk that question.

Bachpan mei konse cartoon dekhe

Acting from an unquestionable authority not stemming from any actual competence but just from your real soul that id like that.
Now since it's unquestionable. No one will raise finger on you.
Don't let go of intimidation with people you can't play along with.

Have you tried sharing about thi(maybe mbtu type, etc) with anyone else. (Know there communication web and who they convey information first.)

What kind of person is the entity Agrim in your head? Answer without filter in more than 100words. <100marks>

Do homework/assignments/etc together on video-call or library 

If you have to explain this creature to other human being what will you say?

Be vague and let other person fill gap for you. (Lying and rapport)

Show other person they have autonomy and aren't being dominated

Humans first establish behaviour baseline and.use it to detect lie.
(That's why you can lie nicely when you are in a energy state which other erson don't know of so don't know.what behaviour to expect)

Familiarity (common interest ) - (soft spoken person with soft spoken person) helps building rapport.

Detect lying (dropping of tone), change angle of head, scrunching of face, playing with fingers, eyebrow raise.
If person is deliberately lying you can use it to develop intution to catch their lies when they lie non-deliberately.
Also another fun things~
When they lie deliberately vs when lie non-deliberately they may lie in different way.
Like one time spouting untrue things unnecessary details and other time staying short and vague.
Like saying lie i graduade with high school diploma but on other thing just saying few word.
There is discrepancy on lie method.

Show you know they are lying but show empathy kindnes

You can tell how a person feels about an human by tone of their voice when they take pronounce like - them (my siblimgs) or she (mother), you can tell how they feel about them by just listening closley.

When conversation becomes little negative, you **reframe** shift attention to something more possitive to stop stiffness from building.

I love this short-story novelupdate link send.
Talk about it.
Then talk about from how long are they reading their first book?
Then tell them your first and how u got into it.
Ask them have u ever.
Praise their taste?
What's your genre favourite character.

But he didn't improve just he made sure to do delete for all everytime.

  
  
Use small talk to find common ground & **build rapport** 
Instant rapport when you meet person of same country in foreign.
In 90sec, inst rapport. Mimic voice tone, body language, gesture SUBTLy not creepily.
ALWAYS be more **colourful and rich** with small talk and explanation, don't be how was your weekend. Nice! *boring*
Intend to find common ground even if other person not interested.
Give lot of extra/free details.
**open ended talk and explain**
In JPM when asked of home you didn't give them useless info that can help more rapport. By saying I live in __ i moved here x years ago before that I was and did.

Pick up on free information.
You can sus out and follow up ont hibg that will make person tick with you.
Like in local train
I haven't seen you here before?
. Oh yes, I am new ts my first time, i am starting my new job at ad agency here in town.
. Oh yeah, I know It's tough to get seat here at this hour but....
*this person missed out on free information 
New job (ask more, share self connection with tha)
New town (old where from)
Ad agency? Do they stick billboards? (Indirect way of asking, by purposely saying wrong thing what do they do in ad agency)
How long have u work in ad agency field *

Deliberately try to push charm button on, you do Se but you aren't there like time when that person trying to sell you RO came ore ith mom when you do that to blockway and away from screen not see it's constant you talk without your mind there but thereat same point.

Meet them on human level. Human experience.
Shows they enjoy
Friends 
Family
Hobbies 
If they have pessimistic life then just funnily joke to steer away the -vety

  

Never give full information away in front of arrogant.

  
  
  

  
  
  

My value is in reserving garden and giving it to special person that's why it hurt seeing people decrease it's value and singnnificance but they lack depth to have deeper garden so..

  

It betrays the depth of the emotion and implications i have attached and depth matters.**


REGAL? REASON-
I dont like other people reading me, so if my body has calculative elegant move, it will come off as uninterpretable.
I have to learn to switch between shameless excited personality then to Regal demanour to create potential difference & have best of both world.
Mystery + Open-Book.
In front of Bois being an energy powerhouse will serve better not mystery.

I have realised my mind is like.
World assaults me with chaos (SST SIR)/(HOw not to hurt shubhankar & karitkey feeling)/(how to answer mom question)
I morph, bend
Well that passed
I FORGOT OF WAVES THAT I LEFT IN OTHERS. i am too present moving focus because I am not really putting Ni there, i see it as inferior Se work.

Walking encyclopedia.
Very symathetic & strong moral compass due to Fi.

Ne(Inferior) - afraid of future, world is falling, history repeat itself, 

they want to find & create ideal future by collecting info9rmation & find answers.

their moral duty to tell people about duties

Often time unaware of social rule - social norm - come off as social awkward BUt 
Si-Hero GOD at remembering. IStj remeber. Obsessessed with aquring answers.

they’ll be first one to say how shitty wikepedia is but still go to wikipedia themselves.

Si+Fi - may get stuk in rut & lasiness - Oh i am not in mood~ - May waste 10-20 years in same place.

hey talk reference point all time (his book/person/article said this)

they may forget to verify knowledge they gathered or better would be MOSt times they dont vertiufy knowledge. So for their Maturity they need to VERIFY.


May just load information but never use it.
their ti critic will cristise others but they themselves never vertify their info themselves.

they may instantly believe credentials/titles/degrees.

susceptible to group think.

Journalist (IStJ) who kept relying on just any info & post it as it is without vertifying, so one day one person reported him & he ended up loosing job BUt after that ti-critic always  vertify information.

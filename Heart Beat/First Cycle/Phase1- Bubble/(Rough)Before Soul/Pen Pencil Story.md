To tell the story induce NATURAL SCENARIOS not a story time, CUZ they may notice you trying to boast or put forward and image of self.
This will feel spontaneou.
Beautiful pens. Expensive pen talk see AMAZON open, tell you were just looking at pen.
Body beautiful matters can exchange refil with something else
From there.
Talk of Pen Fights (talk 2-3 min MINIMUM) (In lunch nad b/w class do)
Pencil or Pen exchange.
I one time exchanged (50-60rs pen-pencil)

*I was 9-10-11yr old. (don’t tell AGE make it sound like it was in higher class, through topic of expensive pen, make pen-pencil too not something of 4th-5th class but an luxury item)*
**i really wanted pen pencil** (Say this first, it sets better tone, and increase mischeviousness projection factor)
There was a girl in other class, who had very **beautiful** (bhot sundar) pen-pencil.
*I KNEW IR ISN’T POSSIBLE FOR me to EXCHANGE* (Mere pass 5rs-10rs ke pens aur pencil)


**Pik**
**i don’t know meri kya conversation hui, but sayad it was me praising pen-pencil, showing my pencils,**
Ttell you exchanged with pen

**Bois**/**Fem**
*I never had chances of getting pencil in directly asking*
**i also had once BEAUTIFUL pencil  if not expensive. talked of pencil, tried *==using that pencil ==* 
(knew won’t get) Tbbhi ==subconsiously== trying to coax**
So that sayad me usse end mein convince krlu 5-6 different design pens-pencil.
**But somehow usne hi mujhe exchange ==***PROPOSE*** kiya==
I was shocked YEE KYA HO GYA.
**MUJHE EXTRA LEADS aur PENCIL dono mil gyi**


I FELT I DID WRONG, ==i wanted normal pen-pencil== but GOT EVEN BETTER but felt wrong.
I was worried uske mummy papa notice krenge, DISTINCTIVE PENCIL thi, kya gyi? TEACHER SEE COMPLAIN
**Teacher see Maar/Daat to secondary chizz hain** (SHOW your Fe Values)
==I will have to lower my head==
SO SO SO SO
***==HONOURABLE THING==*** now will be for me to go
RETURN PENCIL 
but Problem is HOW kya bolu.
I am thinking in terms of maths ki 5rs penil, 50-60rs pencil. 
**i am not considering**
USNE to PRICE BHI NHI PUCHA
==she took pencil so she saw some value in it which was more than her attachment and like to that pencil==
HOW WILL I MITIGATE THAT?







**i don’t know meri kya conversation hui, but sayad it was me praising pen-pencil, showing my pencils, i also had BEAUTIFUL collection even if not expensive**
(Don’t say) Usse unme see ek pencil pasand aagy (NOPE, you ain’t coming off as cunning, don’t give her autonomy)


My mom won’t let me buy expensive PEN/PENCIL but can bring many small one

COAXING to be presented an offer

**She liked my pencil we ended up exchanging**

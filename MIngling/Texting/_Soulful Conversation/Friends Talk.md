my friends are drifting apart
I'm trying to keep it together
Loki — 07/17/2023 2:52 PM
Hardest thing to do
Beebs — 07/17/2023 2:52 PM
but now my best friend is living out of state with her husband
so we can't just plan impromptu hang out sessions anymore
Beebs — 07/17/2023 2:54 PM
we met in elementary school
I was weird, she was weird
we connected
she has designs of all of us living in a big house by pooling our incomes
I'm skeptical but I want to believe

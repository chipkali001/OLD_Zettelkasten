Kids throw bags through windows then tell the teacher they are from the basketball club and running away.

One time i hitted arpan’s MP. He collapsed and wriggled on ground like fish. 
I took this  opportunity and ran away as fast as I can.
I took shelter point in class.
He found me fastly and I know he was there for my blood.

We played kho kho taking pounds of  all 3 rows jumping over benches for 4-5minutes that is when mukesh entered the class. 

Arpan got super power all of sudden and he lifted the chair to act cool maybe? We were dumb.

There were  3 rows and I jumped from the top of the middle row to the other row.

He was struggling because his speed decreased as he was lifting the chair.

That is when I  saw MOTE WALE HINDI SIR (6’3ft) and he saw me. I froze and Arpan saw me freezing so he looked back and he too put his seat back.

Sir came to beat us both and unhone hme khub sunayii buri wali.

Mukesh was trying to suppress her laugh on sidelines 

Well while i am explaining the story. The incident happened a long time ago so i don't remeber the exact sentences what someone spoke so when i am referring to 

Is the tone, the motion, the intention.

Let me tell you a little background.

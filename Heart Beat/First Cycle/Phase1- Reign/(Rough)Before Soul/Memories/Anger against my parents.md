# Anger against my parents

## 
I think one thing that i remember is

I don't used to enjoy going out and playing sports cuz it was too boring everything was repetive. It was just too dead thing for me to take pleasure in it. 

But i used to love to talk about things that are happening in games, tech world, facts about universe that i learned through YouTube videos and other things i browsed through internet.
## 
But i remeber my mom criticising you  only talk and don't do physical activity game and my father saying "aaise ghanto tk baat ldkiya krti hain" and at that time i had an lens over my mom and dad as God so any hatred and anger and dissatisfaction i felt was just turned inside myself.

-They never tried to help me grow in any other direction than the one they wanted me to go.
**My actions were seen as utlitity and value they derived out of it, they didnt listened what are my feeling & emotions, what these things ever meant. If i like doing something  other than study - addiction**


If they don't want to help . Atleast don't interfere and let me do whatever i want to do.
## 
I used to love watching art craft videos on TV and try to recreate it and my mother father saw it as waste of fevicol. If they think what i am doing or creating is waste. They should tell me what i should build better or how should I build better. It wasn't like i was hell bent on creating something cranky?
## 
I remember father used to remove channels from tv few months before exam. No tv until exam over. I wasnt a disobedient child, i always did my homework, prepare test, i did everything diligently. I havent met anyone in my childhood who was as sincere and serious about study.
## 
They also blamed all my brothers shortcoming on me. Suppose i play xyz game and suyash too play xyz games, he play 5-7 orher games  too and watch some other cartoon and what not but they will only count what we have in common and just put all blame on me and will tel me stop playing this. Tum apne bhai ko bigad rhe ho. and because of me putting so much value, respect on them it really really devastated me. 
## 
I also rebr that in tatasky there were games. You can pay earn points and use that to buy, thing i collected lot ofnpoimts after working so so hard. I wanted remote control aeroplane, so so badly. But i lost patience cause it require one of highest amount of points and decided i will first buy something to lower for testing then i will buy aeroplane

and my order didnt arrived for god knows how many months i so so so badly wanted it and when it finally csme apparent mummy had hidden and they gifted it to me neighbours child. I remeber the pleasure of anticipation and the hatred i felt for being cheated. Its a talk of 3rd or below class. It can be anything below 

I made various attempts to make aeroplane that can fly by watching different videos on YouTube and i will work hard to make it

My mom will not let me have my gift she we will strore them in bed and then gift them back again to other on their birthday

I remember in class 5-6-7(idomt remember exactly) The thing that gave me joy and thing i used to look forward to was playing clash of clans. 

Because playing online games gave me that desire for friends with common interest. It has option to chatsith people and it was overall really fun.

It filled my life with meaning.

But my father has always been so judgmental. He will always say oh you are addicted to video game. Scold me and get angry at me. Even thought it wasn't interfering with my normal life. Little bit. I used to dilligently do my work, study for school, extra prepration aside from my school. But if someday i get lower marks in test. They will say it's your game. Whatever i do the problem is game. But it was okay.

If my rank in exam is low. It's game. There were so many factor but they were just hell bent on just snatching things away from me.

I think the time period i played clash of clans was 2nd peak period (1st 8th class, 3rd fifth class)  of happiness of my entire childhood.

Ayush soon started playing clash of clans and my happiness was soaring though roof. Ayush and i have been friends ever since we were little. I used to call him my best friend but slowly we started becoming but distant because he was interested in becoming cricketer and i studies and video games. You didn't have much value for study and he didn't had means to ply video game. I too thougt cricket as boring but i guess two of us playing same game. Rekindle that flame of friendship and it was so nice. We will always have something volatile and interesting to talk about and it was so so so much fun.

But one thing happened. 

I had one friend in school. Rudra. He was arrogant and highly narrsictic personality and i have now learned through book that my childhood personality high agreeable, compassionate, oversensitive type of person attracts narrsictic people but he was smart and was curious interested in maths science and highly competitive. He was son of one of my favourite teacher in school Monika mam( she was really cool teacher). She was my science teacher and in zero periods i used to go and solve olypaid books. Mam will help. He was the first person i met who i felt was somewhat like me but he was not good. If there was some fault or wrong thing he did and complain went to Monika mam. He will shift blame on me. And i felt sad but he was first person who i felt was similar to me and i kind of understand that out of fear you can push blame on other.

If some incident made him angry or i rub his ego wrongly. He will say Monika mam tell me to tell you you shoudnt come to her. He will just say anything and i was far too innocent. I mean intutively i felt he was doing something wrong with me but i had this acceptance. 

He was the first friend. With whom i actually have some sort of serious fight (not physical) (enemy friendship)

He was the thing that bugged me the most in 6th 7th. I just wished for him to go to another school cuz as long as he is in the school i wont be happy. 

But despite all this the period of clash of clans which was in my 6th 7th clas time frame was still best time.

Rudra too started playing clash of clan. I felt really happy when he did that cuz i will have one more friend to talk with and enjoy.

He was irregular with timingd he played game but it was okay.

One day in school, he asked me to create a whatsapp group for clash of clans so we can discuss what timing we all are going to come online.

I made a group, we chatted but he left the group without telling anything.

I asked him. what happened he said he quit by mistake and asked to add him again. I did and everything was fine. But then Monika mam complained in school group that i am forcing rudra to play clash of clans. He don't want to play games but i add him to groups again and again. He was poor boy being pestered by me and i am trying to send him on wrong path.  (He wants type of person that naive 6-7th clas me can control. He was too arrogant.)

But my parent were enraged that i have humiliated them in front of all cuz complain was sent in classgroup where everyparent in class was there and as i told you they wanted to take game away from so badly for a long time and now they had perfect.

But i just felt devastated m. I didn't understand what happened. I also felt humiliation cuz i have been a good child to my parents, never lying, gaali dena, cheating in exam or doing something bad. and no complain about me has ever come to them except i was talkative so i guess it was i dont know they blamed me. I wa really really sad and it was my downest period before class 8th. I didn't understand the feeling i was feeling. A childer of that age don't know how to deal with shame and public humiliation. Next day i school our mam scolded me and i started crying in front of everybody cuz i just don't know what to say, i was shy and just couldn't speak much. I was oversensitive so i just you know felt shame so much badly. They game that used to give me meaning in life was too stripped away. My mom dad took my phone away. I complained about all this to my best friend ayush of what happened and he just said it was my fault and he think rudra is right. So i guess every person i knew. My mom, dad, my best friend, my favourite teacher. It was not something that 10-11year old me knew how to deal with.
Many times i will just feel to infuriated

I was trying to make aeroplane through YT VIDEOS. (I ACTUALLY WANTED REMOTE CONTROL AIRPLANE FOR SO LONG.
FROM TATASKY WATCHING (THERE WAS GAME, YOU PLAY EARN POINTS, AND TAKE GIFT)

I LOST PATIENCE AND I WANTED TO TEST IF THIS GIFT THING WORKED SO I BOUGHT SOMETHING, IT CAME BUT MY MOTHER GIFTED IT TO MY NEIGHBOUR BHITYA.  I WAS SO NAGRY CUZ I HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO COLLECT THOSE POINTS)

*I for so long gave them credibility, i should never never have, my intutive intelligence is way way way more smart and wiser and would have lead me to better path than them.
Yes i am grateful for opportunities but mentally i would have been better state if i was born in an orphanage.
Overall, i am not discounting out all of their efforts and time, but just an net sum
Atleast that was what CHILD AGRIM SAW THINGS*

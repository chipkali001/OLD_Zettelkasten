I used to exchange pencil/pen with my friends when I was younger.

One class younger human being used to sit next to me in exams and we used to talk so we became friends. Junior had a beautiful looking pencil which I liked.

We talked and decided to exchange our pencil

And I lost that pencil, which scared me out.

I later learned that the pencil was 5 or 10rs more expensive than my pencil.

What if junior’s parent complained 

Whenever I see that junior. I will freak out and start worrying what will I respond with if the junior asks where is pencil?

MC IS WEAK OR BETTER SAY HE IS NOT REALLY THAT MUCH STRONG BUT HE HAS AN ACE WHO IS OVERPOWERED AND VERY VERY STRONG. MCâ€™S PLAN GOES FLAWLESSLY BUT JUST IN MIDDLE SOMETHING HAPPENDS AND THE PERSON WHO WAS SUPPOSE TO BE THEIR ACE DIES DUE TO SCHEME OF THE NEEMY THAT MC DIDN;T SEE COMING. 
MC WILL BELIVE THAT OVERPOWERED DUDE DIED BUT IN REALITY
 OVERPOWER PERSON AFTER DEAD COMES BACK TO LIFE AS UDNEAD OR SLAVE OF ENEMY AND HE BECOMES ACE OF ENEMY (MC WILL LEARN THIUS LATER)

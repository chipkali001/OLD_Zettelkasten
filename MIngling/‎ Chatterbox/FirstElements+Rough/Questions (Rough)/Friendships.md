While the vastness of space is a popular answer to this one, you never know what kind of interesting thing the person you are talking to might come up with. And why waste the chance to go “whoa.”

146. What’s the title of the current chapter of your life?

This answer depends a lot on their current mood and how they are looking at the world at that moment, but it’s good to know what they are going through.

147. Among your friends or family, what are you famous for?

Perhaps an amazing talent? Maybe a unique character trait? Possibly even something that isn’t true. Whatever the answer, it’s sure to be something fun to discuss.

148. What is something that your friends wouldn’t believe was true about you?

Often a person’s reputation doesn’t completely live up to reality. Find out what their friends think about them and what the real story is.

149. What’s something horrible that everyone should try at least once?

It could be a food, activity, place, or something completely different. Whatever it is they choose, it’s bound to be interesting.

150. If you had a personal flag, what would be on it?

I like this one because it forces you to think outside the box. It also tells you a lot about the person’s aesthetic and probably a little about their personality or what they value.

151. If your life was a book, what would its title be?

Another one that is more entertaining the more creative you get with it. It can be a lot of fun trading titles back and forth and discussing why you chose the title you did.

152. As the only human left on Earth, what would you do?

Who doesn’t love a good post-apocalyptic story! And what they think they would do can tell you about their personality and what they think is important.

153. What stats for your life would you most like to see?

It can be anything. Steps walked. True loves passed on the street. Percentage of the World seen. You can get as creative as you want with this one.

154. What did you think you would grow out of but haven’t?

It might be something positive that they are happy they held onto or perhaps a negative habit that has persisted. Whatever they come up with will probably tell you something about who they are now and possibly who they want to become.

155. What are three of the most significant numbers in your life?

This one is great because it’s a fun and creative way to learn more about the person. I would suggest they tell you the number, and you guess what it refers to, but there are way too many ways that could go wrong. So, steer clear of that little game.

156. What are some of your personal “rules” that you never break?

Everyone has rules for themselves that they try to follow. Find out which ones they follow most diligently.

157. What’s the best and worst piece of advice you’ve ever received?

A great question to ask because you might just pick up some excellent advice. And it’s always good to ponder previous advice you’ve been given as well.

158. What song or artist do you like but rarely admit to liking?

Ah, the guilty pleasure songs or artists. We all have some songs or artists that are so cheesy or cringe-worthy that we are a little embarrassed that we like them. But I say embrace them!

159. What annoys you most about the in-groups you are a part of?

A lot of people don’t really think of the in-groups they are a part of and how they affect their lives and beliefs. Some examples of in-groups you might be in: a country, a political party, a school, a fan of a sports team, a religion, a club, a race, a follower of a hobby, a watcher of a TV show, etc. There are so many in-groups that we all are a part of.

160. What small gesture from a stranger made a big impact on you?

It could be a kind word, a kind gesture, a piece of advice, or something else entirely. And just remember, you can be that stranger that has a big impact on the lives of others.

161. What do you regret not doing or starting when you were younger?

It can be interesting to talk about paths not taken and what might have been. And we all wish that our earlier selves did something to improve our current self. Just remember that in 5 years you’ll be looking back and wishing you had started something. As they say, the best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, but the second-best time to plant a tree is today.

162. What’s the dumbest thing you’ve done that actually turned out pretty well?

You always have to love when you stumble into a good outcome after a bunch of bad decisions. Sure, it doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s always satisfying.

163. If you had to change your name, what would you change it to?

The trick to this question is the “had to,” most people would just prefer to keep their name. But it’s always interesting to hear what they would choose if they couldn’t keep their current name.

164. When people look at you, what do you think they see/think?

I like this question because by explaining the gap of how they think the world views them versus what they are really like, you get to learn a lot about them.

165. What can you not get right, no matter how many times you try?

A lot of times, we have something that we’ve tried and tried, but whether it’s from lack of commitment or outside factors, we just can’t seem to nail it.

166. What question can you ask to find out the most about a person?

This is another question that I love because you learn something about them from the question they choose to ask. And when you answer their question, they learn more about you.

167. As you get older, what are you becoming more and more afraid of?

It’s odd how fears change when you get older. You slowly lose your fear of some things while others take their place.

168. What lifestyle change have you been meaning to make for a while now?

No need to wait for New Year’s, any time is a great time to make a resolution. Find out what some of their personal goals are and share some of your own goals as well.

169. In what situation or place would you feel the most out of place?

By talking about where they feel most out of place, you can often tell what kind of place they feel most comfortable in. And if you can’t, well, that can be your next question!

170. There are two types of people in this world. What are the two types?

Yes, I know there aren’t two types of people in this world. But it can be a lot of fun to come up with examples. Even if there are always exceptions and you can’t truthfully generalize like that, it can still be a fun question to answer.

171. What personality trait do you value most, and which do you dislike the most?

It’s funny how different people have different personality traits that they hate more than others and other traits that they admire more than others. It’s almost like we each are social puzzle pieces designed to appeal to some people and not to others.

172. When was the last time you [changed your opinion/belief](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-risky-is-it-really/201007/why-changing-somebody-s-mind-or-yours-is-hard-do) about something major?

This question is great for seeing how likely they are to change their opinions or beliefs once they’ve settled on them.

173. What would you do if you knew you were going to die in one day?

This is a great one to ask yourself or others. It’s a great way of putting life into perspective and letting you know what is important in your life to you.

174. What are some of the events in your life that made you who you are?

There’s no doubt that the events we’ve experienced have a huge effect on who we are and how we view the world. It’s always good to know what kind of events shaped the person you are talking to and how they chose to view those events.

175. If life is a game like some people say, what are some of the rules?

This can turn into a really long, fun discussion about the hidden rules that we all live by. You can take it in a serious or a more playful direction, both are fun and rewarding.

176. They say that everyone has a book in them. What would your book be about?

Fiction, non-fiction, autobiography, textbook? What kind of book do they think they would like to put out into the world?

177. What could you do with two million dollars to impact the most amount of people?

The focus here isn’t necessarily impacting them positively or negatively, more about the sheer volume of people. Could you do something that impacted every person on the planet?

178. What would be some of the most annoying things about having yourself as a roommate?

I love this one because it forces you to look at some of the less pleasant aspects of your personality that you might not normally think about.

179. What do you want to be remembered for?

Very similar to the epitaph question, but while that question was more the short and sweet version, this one is great for elaborating on what they think of as a good life.

180. If you could make one rule that everyone had to follow, what rule would you make?

Will it be something altruistic? Something selfish? Something silly? Only one way to know!

181. What’s something that happened or something that someone said that changed how you view the world?

As we get older, the way we view the world shifts and changes. Sometimes it’s gradually and sometimes suddenly. Find out how they view the world by finding out what changed that view.

182. If you were put into solitary confinement for six months, what would you do to stay sane?

This question might let you know a little bit about how much they need social interaction, it might also give you a clue into what brings them peace or purpose.

183. If you could have a video of anyone event in your life, what event would you choose?

I love this one because it is so open-ended. It can be any event big or small. It could be something momentous you don’t want to forget, or it could be to answer a long-standing question about the event.

184. What incredibly strong opinion or belief do you have that is completely unimportant in the grand scheme of things?

I mean, I guess you could say no opinion or belief is important in the grand scheme of things, but let’s not get nihilistic here. This question is more about putting opinions or beliefs into perspective.

185. What are the top three things you want to accomplish before you die? How close are you to accomplishing them?

This one is a big question that everyone should probably ask themselves. And the person you are talking to might not have an answer, but it’s also fun and enlightening to brainstorm about possible things you both want to accomplish before you die and try to narrow it down to three.

186. If you could convince everyone in the world to do one thing at one point in time, what would that thing be?

Give them time to think about this one, it’s more interesting the more creative you get with it. You could go in all kinds of different directions with this one.

187. If you had a clock that would countdown to any one event of your choosing, what event would you want it to countdown to?

Most people will probably say their death. But some people don’t want to know when they’ll die. You can also get pretty creative with it. When will humans colonize another planet? When will you find the person you’ll marry?

188. What do you wish you could tell yourself 10 years ago? What do you think you’ll want to tell your current self 10 years from now?

Similar to the question about what you regret not starting when you are younger, but this one is a little more in-depth. Feel free to skip this one if you covered enough regret ground in the earlier question.

189. If you were forced to relive one 10-minute block of your life again and again for all eternity, what 10 minutes of your life would you choose?

Sometimes our lives spin on moments, and sometimes in those moments, we make mistakes. What would be great to take back control of and fix the error you made.

Another fun way you can get to know people on a more intimate level is through conversation games like [never have I ever](https://conversationstartersworld.com/never-have-i-ever-questions/), [21 questions](https://conversationstartersworld.com/21-questions-game/), or [truth or dare](https://conversationstartersworld.com/truth-dare-questions/).

VERY PERSONAL QUESTIONS TO GET TO KNOW SOMEONE BETTER

These questions can lead to some deep, sometimes painful discussions. Best to save these questions for when you are both ready for a more serious discussion. We also have some [personal questions to ask a guy](https://conversationstartersworld.com/questions-to-ask-a-guy/personal-questions-to-ask-a-guy/), [personal questions to ask a girl](https://conversationstartersworld.com/questions-to-ask-a-girl/personal-questions-to-ask-a-girl/), [deep personal questions](https://conversationstartersworld.com/deep-conversation-topics/#personal-questions), and [deep questions to ask a friend](https://conversationstartersworld.com/questions-to-ask-your-friends/#Deep-questions-to-ask-your-friends).

190. Have you ever saved someone’s life?

This one is a bit hit or miss. Most people haven’t. But if they have, it’s probably a pretty impactful moment in their life. Just make sure they are comfortable talking about it.

191. What are you addicted to?

While we all are addicted to something, some addictions are way more harmful than others. So, you might want to be a bit wary about this question. It can easily slip into dark places or it might not be something they want to talk about.

192. What keeps you up at night?

Existential dread? Daily stresses? Irrational fears? Internal chatter? All kinds of dark avenues to turn down with this question.

193. What lie do you tell most often?

We all lie to ourselves; the trick is knowing that we do and spotting the lies. Hearing the lies they tell themselves might help you face the lies you tell yourself.

194. What do you regret not doing?

We all have regrets, some of us have more than others. Some are small, and some are life-changing. But what matters is if you can let go of them or do they still haunt you? And just remember most people regret more the things they didn’t do than the things they did do.

195. What gives your life meaning?

This is a pretty big question for all of us. It might be family, work, hobbies, or religion. Or something else entirely. Whatever it is, it is sure to play a big part in who they are.

196. What are you most insecure about?

Our insecurities can be one of the hardest things to talk about and even harder to let go of. If the person is being honest with you, tread carefully, it’s some emotionally unsteady ground.

197. What bridges do you NOT regret burning?

Everyone talks about how they wish they hadn’t burned this bridge or that. But who are the people they are glad that they cut out of their life?

198. What’s the most illegal thing you’ve done?

This one can often lead to some funny stories or some decidedly unfunny stories. It’s a bit of a mixed bag, so I put it in the very personal section just to be safe.

199. How do you get in the way of your own success?

This is another question that can cut deep. A lot of people sabotage themselves when they start doing well. And the reasons why they do are often deep-seated and primal. Or sometimes, it’s just a personality trait.

200. What are you afraid people see when they look at you?

This is another question that attempts to get at deep-rooted insecurities but in a roundabout way. It can be pretty effective in bringing out insecurities we didn’t even know we had.

201. What’s the most surprising self-realization you’ve had?

This is another question that can go positive or go dark, and there is really no way of knowing which way it will go. So, I decided to tuck it in this section just to be safe.

202. How do you hope you’ll change as a person in the future?

I like this question because it’s a positive way of talking about shortcomings. It focuses more on improvement rather than just the bad side.

203. What’s one thing you did that you really wish you could go back and undo?

Another question that is all about regret. But it can be rewarding to think back on what we regret and how we would do it differently now. It helps us make better decisions in the present.

204. What do you most often look down on people for? What do you think other people look down on you for?

This is a negative question in general, but it can help people realize their prejudices and hopefully examine them and see if they hold up to scrutiny or if the prejudices are just things sticking around because they haven’t been examined.

LIST OF FUN QUESTIONS TO ASK

Feel free to cherry pick the ones you like or go through them like a list. Just remember that the point isn’t to ask all the questions, but rather it’s to have a great conversation!

1. What would you name your boat if you had one?

The Unsinkable 3? The Cowboy Bebop? The Please don’t Sink? Your choice! Also, what would it look like? Do you want a motor yacht, a sailboat, or perhaps a dinghy?

2. What’s the closest thing to real magic?

With a new “smart” something coming out almost every day, what products amaze and astound you the most?

3. Who is the messiest person you know?

If your answer is “I don’t know any really messy people”, that means that the answer is you. You are the messiest person you know.

4. What will finally break the internet?

Take this question in a serious direction or a funny direction, either way it’s sure to get an interesting answer. Maybe even get a good conversation going.

5. What’s the most useless talent you have?

You’ve got one, we’ve all got one. I’m pretty good at estimating what time it is, or maybe it’s just confirmation bias.

6. What would be on the gag reel of your life?

Those moments when the audience that has been watching your life bursts out in laughter.

7. Where is the worst smelling place you’ve been?

You know, that place where you gagged and almost threw up? Yeah that place!

8. What celebrity would you rate as a perfect 10?

Great for guys or girls, see how your ideal type matches up with your friend’s. And if you are horrible with celebrity names like me, just think of a movie or show with a perfect 10 in it and [IMDB it](http://www.imdb.com/).

9. What’s a body part that you wouldn’t mind losing?

You’ve got lots of body parts! Surely there a few you could part with. Who knows, maybe missing a few toes will become a fashion statement!

10. What is the dumbest way you’ve been injured?

Let’s face it, we’ve all had some injuries that were caused by less than dignified circumstances. So lets hear them! Everyone loves a good cringe worthy story.

11. Which fictional character would be the most boring to meet in real life?

Sure it’s easy to focus on the exciting, thrilling characters. But how about showing the boring ones some love!

12. What is the best and worst purchases you’ve ever made?

Oh we’ve all made some seriously bad purchases, so what are yours? And what about the best purchase, and where can I get one?

13. If you had to change your name, what would your new name be, and why would you choose that name?

So how about it? Will you be Inigo Montoya or Hubert Blaine Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff? Or perhaps something a bit more mainstream?

14. What are some things that sound like compliments but are actually insults?

Along the lines of humble brags, but things that you would say to your frenemy. Sorry, as portmanteaus go, frenemy is almost as bad as phablet.

15. What’s your biggest screw up in the kitchen?

Whether you did it when you were a kid or a as misguided college student, you’ve had a seriously bad screw up in the kitchen. So what happened?

16. What’s the worst commercial you’ve recently seen? Why is it so bad?

17. What is the craziest thing one of your teachers has done?

I’m sure we’ve all had that one teacher with a couple of screws loose, or how about the teacher that just absolutely lost it during class.

18. When did you screw everything up, but no one ever found out it was you?

What have you gotten away with? How sneaky were you when you were younger? Or was it something recent that you messed up and got away with?

19. What problem or situation did TV / movies make you think would be common, but when you grew up you found out it wasn’t?

For me it was quicksand, always with the quick sand. That and the memory loss. I’ve never come across someone who had a complete memory loss or quicksand. Sure they exist, but they happen a lot more on TV than in real life.

20. What quote or saying do people spout but is complete BS?

One that always gets me is “Love means never having to say you’re sorry.” You better occasionally say sorry, or there’s a good chance they aren’t going to love you for very long.

21. What’s something your brain tries to make you do and you have to will yourself not to do it?

It could be as intense as the urge to jump off a high place. Or as mild as trying to stop yourself from itching that mosquito bite. Or maybe just saying something you shouldn’t at a really inopportune time.

22. If you could know the absolute and total truth to one question, what question would you ask?

You can make it serious or funny, your choice. It’ll be interesting either way because we’ve all got plenty of questions we want answers to.

23. What’s the most interesting thing you’ve read or seen this week?

Time to share that really cool article or fact that you ran across on the internet. Just make sure to fact check it!

24. What ridiculous thing has someone tricked you into doing or believing?

25. If you were given a one-minute ad slot during the Super Bowl that you couldn’t sell, what would you fill it with?

INTJ general top preference

Extroverted bubby ----—> alooof, cold, detached INTJ 

Some like others hate - someone bossy, boss over them

Bubbly is more something male in female but not female in male. THAT’S WHY you heard of about not laughing at own joke & just saying it with tone of casualness

Shy ones like Fe-Types FUZZY, Smooth, one who says Oh, I luv you so much, you’re the most beautiful.

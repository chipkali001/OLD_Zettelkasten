WHO IS THE PERSON RESPONISBLE FOR SHAPING YOU THE MOST.

In terms of

1) Ideas

2) Experience (same qualities and character traits can't be seen elsewhere)

If that person is missing,

You will be less bright ...or maybe more bright.

(If person is hesitant)

Okay then anser – Are you more bright or less bright?

Why not want to tell? Is it sharam? Or shame? What is it? Sharam about what,

It's okay don' tell me name, age, gender.

Just tell me what change did that person made

IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME, THEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND SAY IT WITH FIRM VOICE,

What are you doing? where will the path leads to? How much have you done?

bDon’t you think people gives too much credit too actors. For example - You must have heard that “Amitab Bachan ka yee dialogue uss movie main ye dialogue tha?” This question in itself implies as if it was amitab bachan who wrote the dialogue but the one who actually write those dialogues are script writers which never even hear of. Actors just reiterate those words? This is absurd? Why do you think people fail to notice this? It pisses me off because they are misplacing credit. Doesn’t this hurt the screenwritter.

Tell about any school trip incident maybe you remember?

Kuch khas incident yaad aata ho

After other person finaih telling story

You can blackmail then into saying.

If i ever meet your parents then i will do your chugli by telling them this story. Fufufufufuu. 

That way i will win her trust too.

Let's talk about summer vacation.

How your sure vacation used to be. Was there a place where used to go every summer vaccation.

Did your school used to take exam before summer vaccation or after summer vaccation? It used to annoy me to no extent when we had exams 3-4 weeks after opening of school because with the burden of exam how can I fully enjoy summer vaccation. School Wale bacho ko kitna dabate hain. 

How was your holiday homework like? I remember they used to give us a bundle of paper, stapled. I always will create plan to finish holiday homework in first week but it will always end few days before school reopening. I used to tell my mom no kid will come on first day after reopening, don't send me, i don't want to go but i was forced. And in my 2nd school in haryana whenever i used to see students in my class who didnt even begin their holiday homework but still get away with it and get full marks. It really really used to make me feel jealous.

Talk about some instance in childhood where aa action of your parent really annoyed you.

Has it ever happened to you, that you are looking at a word and then you wonder is this the correct spelling. i mean i have been using the word for so long but i never looked a the spelling carefully?

When did you have darshan of internet baba for first time. How did it felt like? I remember, St first it was just WhatsApp but soon my father got wifi. so i used to watch lot of horror films. I will download moviee from pirated sites.  I also downloaded games though very less of them actually work. I even created 2-3 youtube channel. I learned Adobe flash and i will make stickmsn right videos and upload it but it not go views. It was only me who used to rewatch it again and again. I was learning to make video games through unreal engine and wanted to upload tutorials lm i even had my father get me a mike but i just hated my voice for a long time since, and hearing my own voice through voice recorder will make me feels worse.

Which songs have moved you, when you listen to them first time.? Which songs are they? 

When did you start writting. Which age or class? 

"----"

What was the motivation behind starting to write? Was it a novel or movie that motivatef to write something (

For me, i loved daydreaming. Novels, movies, anime helped in stirring imagination and they give something good to process but when i watched last Tokyo ghoul. It gave me final push that i want to write something.

In childhood i always thought of writting as some type of magical process. I couldn't fathom how someone can write out of Nothing, something new unique. 

How do they even come up with these stories

On messenger 

X-What are you doing?

ME - I just finished “Hook 1” so i was doing “hook2 (listening to music)”

And will proceed to do “Hook 3”

(In music, if X asks which music, send the whole playlist of List Favourite.)

Which death will you choose. 

1) catch sooime type of disease/cancer firsty it will beign with medication and slowly in the lkast stage of life, you will be on ventilatorm 

2) A quick death like car accident/ plane crash/ meteroid crash but you dont get to say goodbye or thankyou to those you care about.

OK WILL YOUR ANSWER CHANGE IF I MAKE OPTIONs MORE LUCRATIVE.

If you die in instant maybe people who care about you will feel regretful about things they couldn't do together for you or say things they want to say.

If you rot they will suffer seeing you rot bit by bit but you and them get to say and do all the stuff you wanna do.

Also imagine it’s 30 years in future and you have family of your own.

Talk about how we used to arm wrestle in school then ask for arm wrestling match, other person can use both hands 

If you learn other person studied in convent school (Christian)

-   XYZ sounds kind of Christian school to me..?
-   (There are two type of Christian school one where there are idols and one where there aren't so do research what are those types and you can ask) was it xyz or zyx

( ours had idol)

-   I studied in convent school till class 4. It was really strict and rigid and there were nearly 65 students in my class.
-   There was mini cage for rabits and birds. We used to give something from our lunch to them even though it was not allowed. I would ask mom to give me some more so i can feed rabbits.
-   There was a church too. There was a time where i used to daily go to church becoz i learned from bhiya/didi/classmates that they distribute a book( i don't remember exactly but maybe it was book of prayers) once in a while but many time i was about to get it they ran out of book
-   When Christmas came around they would put stars on top of building and decorate school, they would draw out lucky winner prizes, i would seriously hope that i will get lottery but i had bad luck always.
-   We had ritual around Christmas. Which all my friends used to do. We were told that if you make 100 people sign and put that paper under your pillow you will get wish granted. I would tear few pages from my notebook and would ask my friends and classmates, mom, dad, uncle, aunty, dadaji, dadiji and then i will ask them sign. I along with few of my friend will gather together and ask from random stranger in lunch period to sign (we had lunch period in ground so all classes was in ground in lunch time.). Ig was realy scare to ask few people bit we showed courage. But in the end i would get frustrated and i will do signature on behalf of other people on my own. That time there was no imternet so i used to ask dadaji to tell name of his friends and i will make sure to write name with different t could pen a d little different handwriting so i can boast it to my friends.

When you changed school or city what happened yo your old friends. Were you in touch. Did you lost connection. Were you sad  cause of the bonds you will be leaving behind.

Q) When you changed school how did you feel, was it happiness and excitement on first day or did you struggle to understand and for in different conditions. I mean when i changed school i was scared. I don't know anyone and everybody else seems to be friend with each other. I don't knew if i will ever fit in friends here.

 (first ask happiness then later to sadness, saying happiness first will make it look like you expect them to happy but your sadness is justified too and you will give justification and the comfort other person needs to say the negative thing if it happened by sharing little incident and leave it on ambiguous or hopeful note ex- 'I don't knew if i will ever fit in friends here' you don't say later it got worse and friends were bad nor you say i made good friends and we have a nice time together.)

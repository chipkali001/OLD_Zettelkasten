# CHASING AMIT SIR 

Students of our class used to do “aandi baandi sandi jo sir ke paar chu kr nhi aaya uski ___”

One time when we were in ground someone did andi bandi sandi 

All of us ran towards sir and sir saw a mob coming running towards him os he ran away.

Apparently he thought we are there to beat him.

# Day 1

Andrew tate fever on the rise!

He made me know to some of my inherent values which on being crushed and dominated i was feeling shame and bad.

HIS EXERCISE VIDEO, really did a number on me. IT LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE CUZ EXERCISE AND BODY WILL BE A CORNERSTONE IN MY LIFE THAT SUPPORTS ALL OTHER CORNERSTONE BY FILLING ME WITH DRIVE AND ENERGY.

He inspired me to induldge in caffiene. He said it's okay to get addicted to it but i won't get addicted. I will use it as tool!

His discipline and drive is inspirational for me now.

His video when he talked bout sucidal, depressed but at his lowest he was strongest didn't fear death. IT MADE ME LOOK AT MY Tendencies which i considered Sad, Bad, -ve are BECOMING MY BACKBONE

# Day 2

I have decide i will be doing andrew exercises + Trap Shrugs UNTIL JEE MAINS SHIT ENDS. AFTER TGAT WE WILL THINK

Andrew Tate Detailed video on promiscuity really made me even more integrated, strong, more sure of my values.

I am developing a more stronger personality now, earlier i was just dangling through didn't have fixed personality.

I have many "I will" sentences now

# Day 3

Todays day was wasted.

Due to

1) Food

2) Songs

3) Me getting emotional and scrolling quora

4) kacha pakka

# Day 4

at 23:35. dad has lot of hopes from me. he sd special bond for me. he never denied me form buying any book. even f he scold me for not eat bad food, he still make and bring foods. if i don't get selection he will be hurt the most. he boats to all his friends that his big son is Arjun he only sees the eye of the bird. my grandmother said to mom th she wants to see em going to iit before she can die and rest in peace she doens't know if she will remind next year so her dream will come true and she will pay the first installment of my college fee i must be quite of an asshole to just brush it all away and say i plan to drop either way.

# Day 5

2 Times Mastubated.

First in morning when i was having romantic fantasy. I thought lust energy is getting transformed into romantic fantasy and only way to fix this is release that energy.

2nd time there was no reason, i just did it after i finished watching one episode of KINDOM KOREAN DRAMA 2019

I TOOK NAP OF NEARLY 2.5Hr(3afternoon-6afternoon) As I have DECIDED TO ADJUST MY PLAN TO MAKE IT SO THAT I SLEEP AT 2 OF NIGHT

The sheet uncle bought for projetc file arent A4.

Mom was angry or frustated that i am not taking project while too seriosuoly and make it my first priority

# Day 6

It's 7:29 morning and i haven't slept since the name yesterday

I have been wondering WHY DIDN'T I FEEL ANY SADNESS OR WILL TO GET GOOD MARKS IN JEE ADVANCED when mom told that "My father pinned hope on me , told his friends..." "Dadiji wants to see me get into IIT before she can die. she don't know if she'll live next year."

MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD, I HAVE WASTED SO SO MUCH TIME BENDING MYSELF TO LIVE UPTO IMAGE PEOPLE HAVE OF ME.

Happiness and satisfaction of Piku level people in my life>> MY GOALS & MY FORWARD MOVEMENT >>>> Living upto Image

My gradma & father don't know me. She hasn't even heard an single story of my life, what i like to do in freetime, what gives me happiness, what gives me satisfaction

I DON'T BLAME THEM AS THEY WERE NEVER GIVEN TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND ME EVEN ON SURFACE LEVEL.

But i willn't bend my satisfaction and happiness to uphold to their illusion.

TODAY I WILL STAY AWAKE UNTIL I HAVE FINISHED WHOLE IOC

GOAL ISN'T EFFIECIENCY IT'S TO UPHOLD MY WILL, I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE TO WORK LIKE TOROISE FOR NEXT 20 hours cuz of sleepiness what matters is ME STICKING TO MY WILL.

I DO CARE FOR THAT AND I'LL TRY TO SOOTHE THEM BUT NLY WHEN I HAVE POWER

how should i put it, i don't have much good enough example. I am taking extreme example and ge tgist of what is my feeling.

I heard story how in old times, maybe when female fails to concieve male child she was thought as defective and many times husband remarries.

So what happened here was women was a tool for man and his family to FULFILL A FANTASY. Or maybe get A TOOL 'MALE CHILD'.

Now what happens if new iphone or expensive laptop i bought stops meor is hanging a bit too much.

I'll be angry and disappointed,

I would not treat it the same way i would have if it worked normally.

SIMILARY, if women TOOL would have served it's function it would have been treated nicely but it didn't ypu either try to fix or replace it and if you dont have money for both THEN LIVE WITH IT WHILE YOU CUSS It .

I wasted time, Ate food in afternoon and slept after that.

Wokeup around 11:40

# Day 7

Its 0:48.

I have been feeling -ve.

I was wondering, i had wasted so much time and have been trying so hard to not fall into -ve loops yet. I think i have failed. Even after suffering so much, i wasn't able to overcome and become bigger than the source of suffering. Then metnal strength i have gained is so miniscule that attaining and not attaining doesn't even matter.

And i haven't even become mentally strong. I have just learnt to seprate myself

And there are so many people who don't have to even think those things, their structure supports them so firmly, that even if ground below them will shake, structures will support them, There is not really that much effort. It's not fair.

Even doing mundane things like making my project file is painful cuz my brain has so sso many -ve things that it can present to me and make me fel horrible. I can seprate myself from feeelings and not suffer, BUT IS THAT ALL IT?

Am I Suppose to do this for entire life?

I really wish i can die. If there was someway, i can just disapper as if i never exist.

Then my disapperence willn't cause trouble to my parents and i cwould be able to sleep peacefully?

What am i even supposed to do?

Wait till mom dad die so I can die too? There's no way i would be able to hold on that long and I am sure by then other things would have clutched me, i won't be able to die. World will not allow me to.

I guess i will have to watch andrew tate video for strngth i guess?

Yes, sadness is an excuse to not be accountable. If after completing my iit syllabus and getting 6 packs, i still don't feel like is worthless or whatever then you can die.

But first do it.

Basking your hand in ice chilling water, luke warm water, dipping it in fire, dipping in molten lava isn't same just because

The thing that is burning is hand?

It does matter where it is resting.

Not if WHEN FIRE COMES hand gets burned so hand is weak?

YES FIRE WILL HURT YOU ALL THE SAME.

BUT GROWTH IS NOT GETTING BY FIRE FOR NO REASON. THAN IS NEEDED.

HEARD A NICE LINE IN CITIZEN SOILKDER SONG "WHO I AM"

"no i wasn't ready for the shame so heavy ,

maybe they will never understand,

can't keep facing the fire,

i am so damn tired of being who i am.

Everyday i am crying nobody helps

cause the're too busy praying i will be someone else.

Everyday is full of pain they never felt but

they are busy parying i will be someone else

# Day 8

WASTED

# Day 9

WASTED

# Day 10

WASTED till6:08pm.

Summertime Ghost. I watched in afternoon and it left me with feeling of wanting to die and how nice it would feel to be free from all this. To just be nothing and feel nothing.

Maybe i will try to orient my life thinking that i will die after June-July2024 whenver i will leave home and join college.

Cuz then will be begin my divided life, which will bring me more internal shame, hate, feed my wanting to die even more,

EVEN IF PHYSICALLY I AM NOT ALLOWED TO DIE.

I will emotionally die, therefore i should try to make full of this meaningless, hollow, lonely life while i have the chance.

I SO SO SO BADLY CRAVE TO STUFF MYSELF WITH FOOD, WATCH ANIME AND JUST NUMB ALL THIS EMOTIONS AWAY.

It's so difficult and painful just resisting the temptation.

BUT IT SOMEHOW GIVES ME STRENGTH that i will die when my college begins and there is NOTHING WORTH LOOKING FORWARD TOO.

ALL THERE IS JUST LIES, DECEPTION & TAINTED OBJECT.

Everything may have thick sugar coating on TOP.

But on deep inside everything is just ROTTEN, UGLY, IMPURE.

I have to create beauty for myself in my own little world in whatever little time i have before dying.

# Day 11

today i went to get spiral bind my project file. Ashish dewankar printed intro page and certificate and acknowledgement he printed those pages . Ashish dewankar is a kid from my school. i went to school one day, i got his number. but i don't even know when and where i got his number. was it on last seat or was it when sir asked me to get number or maybe the 3rd kid who gave number. i didnt rebe rhis name, face or whatever. but whatever it maybe he helped me by sending project file photos and other stuff for getting 20 marks internal and school related doubt. when i see him in school, i didn't wanted to embarass myself by not even recognising his face. since he had helped so much. so i jokingly said to him on WhatsApp that "i am scared,everything is blur in my memory, i don't remember way to class, j don't remeber layout nor do i remeber anyone's face. everything is blurry. what am I going to do on practical exam day. can you send me how you look like. i am so self absorbed and selfish. i talk to people's without even talking and look at them without even looking. i didn't even knew the face of whom j just talked even after the first period was over on that day i went to school . well. whatever this asking how you look like happened few days ago. coming back to today. while we were trading money. i was thinking. they aren't mugging me right?

WHAT STARTED THAT STREAM OF THOUGHT WAS "When i came i wasn't wearing much clothes, he asked aren't you feeling cold."

Shopkeeper uncle joke "Amiro ko thandi nhi lgti"

IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS LIKE.

Ugh I am so strtong cold doesn't faze me at all

WELL I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO THINGS TO PONDER AND THIN KABOUT, I DON';T HAVE TIME OT THINK OF OUTSIDFE COLD SO I HAVE TO GO WEAR THIS, WEAR THAT, WHATEVER. LET'S GET THE WORK DONE AND MOVE ON WITH LIFE.

But that ALERTED MY INUTION- what if they are like he is rich so let's charge him extra money.

[I tried to think of ways of not being fooled.

I REMEBER MY MOM WORDS - You DON'T HAVE WORLDY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE.

No i thought i don't need experience]

THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE AN IMAGE OF ME IN THEIR MIND AND ALREADY DINSTANCED MYSELF FROM THEM.

They can exploit with very less GUILT.

uncle said isne bhot.km.mee krwadiya and started to laugh? i am getting mug, right? they are.makong.fun of me an laughing at my obliviousness?

ALSO I CAN'T BARGAIN AFTER HE SAID THAT. ALSO HIM BEING MY FRIEND'S FRIEND.

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STRATEGY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOMEONE AND UNLESS PERSON IS VERY DISAGREABLE HE WILL COMPLY.

HOW SLICK.

ME SHOWING MY DISTRUST WILL MAKE FRIENDSHIP WORSE.

i don't even understand. they were talking in dialectical hindi so i thought maybe i am not hearing them properly and they have been making fun of me all the time?

# Day 14

mom talked about how in baghpat i used to create cards, give birthday party to papa or in ftahers day. father have preserved all those cards in an envelope and it all used to make him really happy but i don't donit now. obviously i don't i am not happy or satisfied and somehow father and mother has fallen down on my value system too than they used to be in childhood

# Day 15

Oh god! i just remebered how much i love learning, maybe it's celevrating father's day thing mom told me just clicked an memory in my entire body's nervous system, the old feeling, of hjust how much i loved learning, just how meditative, calm and soothing i used to find studying. It's so unfortuyante that i started too see it as an work, an burden, a boring task, Just how much have the surroundins corruptted, If i had just forgoteen this and never recalled this feeling,

I actually look forward to learning a lot more now suddenly>

I guess i have once agian found one of the piece of me, i forgot.

And important piece that used to make up my identity

# Day 16

mother told father was angry that this is near exam time and i am getting exercise fever now. i should focus on study. My respecting and giving value of such comments of father were what was to my downfall. i am glad i am emotionally detached from all this stuff. he expects me to works like machine and this is mostly due to he himself has never worked or studied really hard in his life. he don't even know what it's is like to study 8-9 straight kch less study16hrs all day long. what a bunch of bullshit. in class 9th&10th i was worki)ng harder than any person, sleeping 3-4hrs, pushing myself to the edge, i knew, studying day and night just during eating i will watch little tv. all i wanted was little appreciation or atleast acknowledgement, and he was just redirecting his anger at me don't watch during eating, eat it fast and study, exam less number ayae, kuch karna hai bahar jao yee band kro. even when i was just watching facttechz video on yt even then. social isolation already increased my sensitivity to do high level and having no friends and my childhood being destroyed hurted me so much but i was atleast you know trying my best working hard as i can . and even there i was still trying my best and just wanted to get away from thei home as fast as i can and go to Kota.

# Day 18

i woke with this fear that i may have brokjen my wrist bones, cause there is produding region in my foreams right when i curl wrist backwards

# Day 19

Today, i once again remember the time, when i just begna watching unacademy and attending plus. My first test. How suprise i wias how a human can solve questions so fast.

How sad i felt in school, yet i tried my best to be strong. Hoping and waiting till things automatically better. I used to have such strong faith.

So much energy, motivation, drive.

Oh god it's so tough.

This isolation has completly wrung out and broken my soul, my anbition, my dreams.

Who knew bearing all this will be so tough

And worst thing is i will soon forget

This heart wrenching pain after maybe few years.

And also even after so much suffering and pain, i have nothing to show somehting me. I am still the same, maybe less delusional but IS THAT ALL IT. Maybe being with delusions was happier and better.

I don't think i was ever able to accept this house fully and had onnection with it like i had at home in baghpat.

If i have close friend, i will maybe want to take them around baghpat sohw them the place and tell silly stories about memories i have with the places.

But with this home, i have nothing worth showing, not even a single thing. I actually don't want to see it myself ever again if i had the option to.

It's amusing how sometime ago, i was saying, i n this home i never helt like home but now i am perfectly fine and happy? And that feels llike a lie cuz it is, oviosuly people, enviornemnt, peer group everything has changed so it won't be same but i odn't think it's reall y that bad and you bhave nothing to share, cuz you did nothing worth sharing and just wasted time crying and whining

# Day 23

One of the reason for my sadness earlier was, me thuinking me getting to iit or not getting iit won't make me any happier. it's an irrelevant for mme. whatsw even the point if i am destiuned for eternal suferring

Remeber the amount of boredom you felt in CJC, stanford, GRM.

The only thing that elevated boredom was me doing something that wasn't the thing all were doing.

Like robotics, sumo initial, sumo final (i thought i was winning so that), CJC group.

You alesys find conversations with Arpan and vrrant bhaiya you were just repeating rialy life.

EARTH IS JUST AN ASHEN, GREY PLACE. Yes there are few moments of beauty every now and then but it’s mostly DULL, boring, REPETITIVE

(Obviously odn’t share your philosophy with otherhumans to not get isolated for negativity and pessimism)

Don’t expect paradise from earth.

Look me in the eyes and say you give shit anbout your JEE.

YOU DON'T.

For you it's about self respect and mom&dad's emotion managing.

YOu know that even if small pve emotion insects gets stick to you.

even iof small -ve emotion posses you it will go away in few hours. it doesn't have power to lcing you for so long and if it does, you will use it as fuel

# Day 24

Earlier

I blamed my parents for my suffering.i thought it was their responsibility to help mme but no one even notice

I told mom that i decided that i will atleast finish Maths Rev, but i couldn't even complete that, i don't know, i haven't done practice, papers, mock test, etc.

Mom told me it's okay, next year have focus on boards,

And i may feel like forget but you may actually know more in subconsious, just feaer blinding you (I FELT MOVED By her still faith in me)

I sneaked out of school, without asking sports sir, I just ray away while hiding my bag to receptin from there CALL sir

# Day 27

I wanted to learn taekowndo in search of brute force not swayong legs and arms.

THEY NEVER TAUGHT US ANY STRATEGY.

STRENGTH TO DEGEAT PEOPLE BIGGER THAN ME.

WHAT POINTS TO HIT. HOW?

Who cares about somestupid kicks

If my kicks will only deliever blunt damage, NOT BREAK BONES, OR MAKE THEM STAGGER, what's Point?

Only physical pain

Is it to confuse or just don't give them time to reatc? It doesn't make sense

Something that will help me defeat people much more biigger in size than me STARTEGY when to use a kick, how to get opening and WHY? just throwing kick on that armor leather type thing without strategy. I DON'T WANT MORE SCORE POINTS.

Training too SIR DIDN"T WANT US TO FEEL PAIN ORSORE NEXCT DAY SO NOT HARD.

Why all this? why repetition? Why

I just want it to end QUICKLY NO TIME

If oponent is bigger than me, my kicks can't make him stagger or break bones.

Tell me what to do and how to tackle situatuion like this.

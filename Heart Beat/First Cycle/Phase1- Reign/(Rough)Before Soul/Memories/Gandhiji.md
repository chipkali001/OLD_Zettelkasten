Kahani ke kirdar/namune jo bhi bolo unka naam hlka hlka phele btana chahunga
(First tell lil info about character after story end, expand more into personality of shubhankar and kartikey.)

Kartikey will say to me often that Me usse jalta hun aur mei chalak insaan hue isliye mene uske bachpan-ke-dost / best-friend ko poach krliya aur un dono ki dosti kharab krdi mere aane see phele wo dono kitne aache dost hua krte thee.
AUR wo yee bhi claim krta thaa ki uske paas mera dimag pdhne ki taakat hai, wo meri shakal dekh kr bta skta hai mei kya soch rha hun.

(Why kartikey considered me chalak was due to 1-2 incident where mam made us stand up, i was like kya fadak pdta hai yha khda kro, bahar kro, baithao, i was trying to be sad. two of them were noisy people i didnt deserved punishment, i wasnt even part of their conversation, i just said few lines & was minding my own words. )


Initial Goal: Sir realise shubhankar innocent, i get extra beating and if i am sole perpeetrator. BAD BAD.
I KNOW I HAVE LOST GAME. I WAS DOING DAMAGE CONTROL
SO How do i solve it, by getting everyone beaten, then even if they say i am orignatior, then it wont be problem since shubhankar and kartieky both loud people see and me shy.
Maybe info sir recieve will be vague. I HOPE. you see i am doing damage control, disaster has happened.

Dilema: Shubhankar punished would want to see me punished, my goal everyone beaten so he will be satited even if i dont recieve bad beating, he will be satiated, BUT SITUATION turned into BULLYING.
And what if shubhankar gets up and join his side.
SIR WILL LOOSE ALL CREDIBILITY THAT HE HAD & MY FATE WILL BE TERRIBLE?
Maybe i should go to him, shake him and say: 4th period mei kartikey hme presan kr rha tha naand i will tell him that topic has turned to Kartikey shenhanigans and how he annoys us. GANDHIJI laugh irrelevant he cant bring it up, i am showing we are together in this, he is too friendly so can be pushed. 
AND SINCE KARTIKEY will think shubhankjar is complaining about him and is annoyed by him, he cant get him to make colliation against me.
**NOW I WASN’T REALLY THINKING LIKE THIS, I KNEW THE ANSWER IN INTUTION, THERE WERE NO WORDS, just my morality of is taking advantage right? 
Kartikey is bad person, he deserved to be burned to death but doing this will be manikpulation to shubhanakr, and i knew saying kartikey bad and he did bad things was an excuse to justify my action - well he annoyed me a lot i did it, there weren’t really actua l feelings of anger involved**

Should i make joke - ashlil baate kr rhe thee - idk english translation i will sound stupid
I dont know





Karti ky narcissistic always maybe used to have control and power yet here he doesnt have that.
Kartikey probably himself searched for manipulation (which was never there) and his own pseudo explanation to feel he is in control by putting me below
Maybe it take little humbleness to imagine that there maybe some variables and things i can't see instead of just sticking all with low resolution image 
Constantly looking requires too much of individual

I dont know why but english sir in class 9 used to think ki main in sb maasum bcho ko bigad rha hu aur pdhai see duur lee ja rha hun. Jabki main unki class main hi hmesa hi sanskari balak ki tarah behave krta tha

And after PTM I was angry at subhankar for using me as a scapegoat and i thought i willnt talk to him now. But one funny thing happened, shubhankar said to me that his mother had told him to stay away from me because main subhankar ko bigad rha hun. (Ptani english wale sir ne kya smjuha tha uski mummy ki aapka balak galat sangat main hain)

Bigadna hota bhi kya hain mujhe smjh nhi aaya? Me drugs wine thodi hi krtga tha

First i am be at chronology and story is long so i will maybe do things aage piche so try to manage it



Mei undono ko chaaras thodi hi fukwa rha tha
Aaisa thodi tha ki hmm piche baith kaar sutta maar rhe hai/ ganja fuuk rhe hain

Kartikey seeing wriggling, i expected him to be strong and unaffected, i didnt do itm hiw dare you blame me and who cares i f you are teacher.
I admired you.
I smiled mischievously and looked down from eyes, 
i Get some time to think or just hide. 
First mischeviously smile, it looks like i think i have cards in my favour
That was my strategy in that time, when i need time to think and i cant show the other person i am thinking and calculating and i hide my emotions behind mischeif cause strong inution may look at me with intution and shine light at me that i am trying to think, 
However being playful & mischevious, it creates lot of layers that intution cant peer into? Playfulness give me power over uncertainity and i can think something logical by then that dont have many holes.
Miscchief you can show control & power even if its fake and dont exist
















In class9th

I was expecting him to hit me,

But he asked 

I saw that we were exchanging pleasantries. This question is dead .  I surrendered internally to fate.

and in hurry i have excuse 

Hindi convert to English.

Kids at back were making me laugh

I was just looking at sir waiting him for to make a move

And he looked at other kids, 

And he asked to explain further what really happened.

I didn't expected this at all.

I think i didn't even faked sincerity nicely (pure white lie) but i probably think the reason was that me struggling to convert Hindi to English cause it actually made my sincerity unknown.

I also realised that sir actually held me in high regard and my words have actuall weight in his mind 

THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T HIT ME DIRECTLY, liKe A RESPCtAbLE hUMAN BEING.

I told my mom, i am innocent unhone mujhe bigada hai 

whi class mei mere dost hai, wo dono bhi iit jana chahte hai.

Mummy nei kha aaga see mt baithna

Mene flow Mai hain krdiya

I was angry, mere upar naam kaisa, mei jayda silent rhta tha wo dono jayda loud personality hai? Mai kyu?

I hated school and i didn't even enjoyed it here and find everything so monotone, boring and in sir eyes we are having so much fun disrupting orde? wTF

I mean i can now see why sir reached that conclusion but i was too emotional to Intuit it. That they have been in same school, same resting boring cycle for so many years, that they will get rusty, i as analomy was able to disrupt little boredom but it was all still boring.

Mujhe undono pe gussaa aaya.

To mene socha mei jb bhi school jaunga unpr chilaunga, inme see hi kisi ne sayad blame mujh pr daala.

Pr mei apni regular seat pe jakar baitha.

Me taayar ho rha tha ke kya bolu.

Aur wo mere side seechla gya mene usse roka to usne bola ki

"Mene usse bigad Diya hai, uski mummy nei mujhse duur baithne ko kha hai"

Mujhe ispr aur gussa aaya, teacher ka ek baar blame Krna chlta hai tum bhi mujhe hi blame kroge?

Aur description awe aaisa feel ho rha tha ki

Wo dono phele bhot hi sanskari aur hunhar bcche thee aur mene aakar unhe bigad diya

Tumne khudki shakal dekhi hai

usne itni masumiyat Mujhe uske muh pr ek baar Marne kaa bhot jayda Maan kr rha tha

"Wo bhot hi hunhar, sanskari ldka nhi tha, aur mei usse ptanhi kya krdiya"

Phir mujhe pta chla ki galti uski nhi thik, 

Kisi 3rd party nee chugalkhori kr diya 

.

But hm tino aalag aalag baithe kuch din tk 

Pr whi dono hi class mei utne cool bnde thee to hm tino wapas aagye aur bs english wale sir ki class mei alag alag baithte thee.

I don't think the three of d were on even the same page.

What i said was language open to multiple interpretation.

That he does this even in other period and previous day

And iwhile i was saying all this actually it was struggle to find words, convert Hindi to ejghosih and i will use Hindi words for word that i coudlnt find 

Kartikey was trying to explain that hewasnt doing anything to me in 4th period. Sir was more concerned with why i was laughing? 

He is emotional concerning to that

I listened with one ear nd out with other and with reaction of what are you saying 

He will sya to sit and will then me to timr in Hindi and sir in Hindi

I try to ny speak but i too time to time Sayed to him in. Hindi

Tum mujhe aur shubhankar ko.kl pareeshan kr rha thee

I feared when shubhankar gets up our misunderstanding will be broken and not being on same page whole spell whill be broken so i wanted to drag him in and make him misunderstand that current topic is kartikeys injustice 

What happened in next ptm was i was ready this is inescapable fate so let's get it over with and move on. 

Even if it's not for gandhiji death, we all sat together and don't distance ourselvso

Next when we arrived  the person sitting there was Hindi wali mam

Normal chiz Hui marks warks dekhe,

Phir mummy ne khud see pucha how is he in class?

I have known teacher ka shared network hota hai so she will have same views as english i am 100% guarenteed she knows of gandhiji incident

Laughing on moon is bhot degenrade thing so it's competly normal for her to have adopted a negative view of me.

Paar mam ne bola, aacha bachha hai, class main thoda chup rhta hai, aur jyda baat nhi krta  hai 

Agar thodi aur mehnat krega to aur achha kr skta hai.

Aur me apna sir niche krke sharmila character ple ckr rkha th 

Mummy ne bola ki mam ne to completly ulti baate ki sir nee Jo kha rha.

Mene bola ki sir ko baate kisi bcche nee batayi jo mujhe pata hi nhi kono, mene unke samney barely hi baat krta hunga. 

Wo jhut bol rhe thee.

To aaise hui jhoot ki saachi pe jiit aur stroy ko happy ending mili

Aur uss incident kee baad see Hindi wali mam, aur sst Wale sir mere favourite  teacher bn gye. Even though for both of them i barely understood a single world

Sst Wale sir ki english mujhe smjh nhi aati thi aur Hindi wali mam high level Hindi bolti thi aur me bhot hi low grade Hindi smjhne ke capable tha 

First i want to give introduction of all characters and little background so that story flow don't break later.

The first good friends i made in school

Shubhankar & kartikey, they were cousins and best fruend

Shubhankar was really funny and above average in studies but teachers loved him because he had really charming personality.

Kartikey didn't get marks in school but he was really good in maths and physics.

Wo Gunda type tha shakal personality see. So tecahers had negative image of him and saw him as stupid student but he was more curious and intelligent

Kartikey was doing class 12th maths and HC Verma we used to talk lot, god, world creation and just lot of topics, he even told me that he considers me his best-friend, he has never tell anyone more secrets to someone else, but i don't know when hating each other due to ego fights.

I was internally very prideful person and i used to impose it on others to get them to respect me. And He was really very narccistic. So we started to have ego fights and first few time i just didn't understand what is happening, all the fights i ever had was physical fight, ya Mera koi dost bura maan gaya.

ii dint have any way to deal with it. i wouldn't Understand why he don't understand.

I remember one day English Wale sir ki class thi and he was really strict aura. In his period class was calm and In perfect discipline.

we were sitting on 2nd bench. rotation aur patanhi hm kya discuss kr rhe thee 

And we just start to shout at each other in the class where everyone else was silent we were just shouting at each other.

Sir asked both of us to stand up and then he moved back to his teaching.

And then we both were like okay aaram see,

 again started arguing as he turned his back but in low volume but in few second switch flicked again and we again started shouting at each other.

I don't remeber what happened after that but we were not beaten.

[He thought that he has mind reading capacity and he can tell what i am thinking….

He will say tu mere see jalta hai, 

He used to say that i have broken the close friendship of him and shubhankar and i have poached his best friend away from him. I did this purposely. by using divide and conquer

I think i should have been more compassionate with him 

—----the amount of nuance you go into must vary person to person group to group

(A lot of these sentence are allready written in story so you should cut paste them here)

There are too many sentences and places in the story where you pulled up your own ego please delete cause other people will notice and will leave a bad impression. Keep them to minimum only. Also I too much detail=boring

It was a normal day inthe 4th period. I was very irritated and feeling very hungry. When the school bell rang, I felt relieved but something unexpected happened. Everyone in my class stood up. I was perplexed by the whole situation.

In little time whole class turned silent. Everyone had little serous look on face the were standing in national anthem position with closed eyes?

Sir too was doing the same which was unusual? 

I asked my friend what is happening here in low voice.

He said ‘tumne subhe sunai nhi thi kya announcmcenet?’ i replied ‘no’. 

'in my natural state i am very absent minded person i don't care or see the small details, to a point that when in 8th class end i changed home to nearly half 12 i didn't knew what switches are for fan of any room other than myself.)

‘He said that today is the day gandhi ji died  and so this is ‘mon’ for that’

(Mera dimag kuch reasons see hila hua tha)

Whole school was silent. I  can hear no sound.

Everyone was serious which was very unusual for me and i started to feel funny

I thought about what will happen if someone laughed under these conditions.

He will surely get beaten up and then suspend (restigate worng cause it means expulsion) from school.

His laugh will resonate in the whole school because the whole school was silent.

Few ganadhiji related memes  came into mind and i was laughing in about no time.

I tried to supress my lauh with my hands.

Seeing me the friend from whom i asked why everyone is standing.

He too starrted lauging and was coverg his hand to hold laughter.

The kids on seat back of us too were supressing laugh.

I was using my whole willpower to stop my laugh but was struggling

I looked at my friend's face.

He looked at mine.

My will faded and we started laughing hardly

And in a few seconds our whole class was laughing while whole school were giving respect to gandhiji.

In sir class i always used to stay silent and tried to become as invisible as possible because sir used to only speak in English and i didn't knew how to listen and speak English. 

 whearas shubhakar was naughtiest and funny kid in the classroom.

Our teacher came although i was sitting on the side closest to sir, he grabbed him by his ear and started beating him.

 Seeing this I laughed more but my hand covered my mouth but ti was dffuclt to supress laugh because he was innocent.

Sir gave him good beating for around 2-3 minutes. Shubhankar ko Jamin pr loota diya.

I now knew that my turn is next and sir ko jb sch pta chlega ki mein akela his culprit Hun snd he was innocent then sir will beat me more.

But i just couldn't stop laughing i was already covering my mouth with hand, pinching myself, i even began to bite myself hardly while my hand cover face.

 then he asked me in english why are you laughing what's so funny.

I was there standing with my head at 45° angle i was little scared and excited at same time to see shubhankar get beaten so badly. And i just can't supress my laugh so all the time, i was just on the verge of laughing but i controlled gained a little control little.

Now my turn was about to come and i was painfully aware of that.

Mujhe apne dost ki chatptati laash ko dekhkar bhot bura bhi feel ho rha tha paar hasi nhi aarhi thi 

Whenver there was some thing i got involved in, it is always my attempt to pull of an innocent face so tecahers will be more gentle but it was talking my all to control my laughyer. 

Sir didn't raised hand on me instantly and asked.

“What’s the matter? Why were you laughing? Whats so funny?”

I thought sir is now going to beat me no matter what i say, he will grab me by ear while i am speaking and begin to beat me.

So i was preparing myself for what will come next after this, that maybe sir will take me to principle office or ca my parents and my class-teacher will surely learn about this.

For some reason my class-teacher hated me, i will te you incident of previous ptm.

We went to PTM, everything went normally and i wasn't expecting anything bad

Aur phir sir ne mujhe or mere bhai ko class ke bahar jakar wait krne ko kaha, aur mere mummy papa ko roka.

Okay, i didn't thought much of that, me and my brother were talking outside and then my mother father came outside and we were just getting inside car that mom started talking to me about what sir ssid.

 in previous ptm he told my parents that because of me that the kids that used to sit around me shubhankar kartikeya bigad Gaye hai

Yee bache class main baith kr teaches ka mazak banate hai unhe galiya dete hai

Class ke aur bacho see batamizi krte he.

The two of them kartikey subhankar weren't like this before i came to school but now kartikey and shubanakr percentage is decreasing from last year. 

Pata nhi, sir ke dimag mai mein kitna bda Harami tha, aur unhe yee baat unke kisi chmche see.

Ever since childhood my teachers always told my mom dad that i am sincere student hai aur meri Jo complain thi ki mein shy and introverted hui aur activities main part nhi leta.

I took pride in being good boy for my mom and dad.

How they saw me was really important

But mere mummy ke dimag me jo meri image thi wo Tut gayi aur mummy mujhe jis nazar see dekh rhi thi wo dekhr mujhe Rona aagaya aur mene btaya mein aaiss kuch nhi krta kartikey or shubhankar tecahers gali dete hai mein gali nhi deta.

And i actually in reality didn't give gali atleast to tecahers because i thought that teaching is noble profession because i learned those values from moral stories.

Mummyy ne mujhpe believe kr liya pr kahaa aaise Longo ke saaith baithte kyu ho kl see seat change karna.

Aur jb mei phir Monday school gaya to shubhankar mujhe khne aaya ki uski mummy nei usse mere saath baithne ko mana kiya hai aur usne mujhe complete version of story sunai, mere mummy ne to ek do dialogue oboe thee.

Mein un dono ke saaith kuch din tk nhi baitha pr class main whii dono ke alawa baki bchee bhot jayda vanilla thee

Khali wo dono hi thode harami thee to utna boring nhi feel hota thaa.

 to kuch din baad hmm english Wale sir ke period mein alag baithte thee aur baki period main saaith baithnw lge 

Okay okay i am getting side rail from the main story.

Hai agar is baar complaint gyi ki main mon, kisi ki death ke.liye shok bna rhe hai, aur main hass rha tha aur baki bacho ko hasa rha tha to 

Mere mummy papa ka mera see Puri trike see bharosa uth jayga

  Sir repeated the question.

I decide to show last resistance.

Now i knew that punsihemt is inevitable and i am in checkmate.

The only thing i can do is to minimize damage and the only way to minimize damage i have to drag as many people as i can with me. Cause the punishment i will get after for alone creating is ruckus will be far worse if 4-5 people create ruckus.

And j can play innocent even just little bit in from of my parents

So the only way out i felt was that i have to drag as many people as i can with me cuz it will proportionately decrease the order of punishment i get.  [Mein dubunga to inhe bhi leekar duubunga]

I was a person earlier who held on grudges for long.

I said the kids on the back were making me and shubhankar laugh, they were pinching/poking us (no need to say kids at were pinching poking, it breaks flow and will make you come off as looser person who let's other people mess with you) , it   and i just turned my face towards them as to signal sir. 

I felt guilt inside me cause even though i said i have enemity but i knew i was doing something bad but justifying to myself by thinking of. it as taking out.a grudge.

Sir looked at them they looked t sir.

They were sitting behind and laughing and now their laughter turned to silence. 

The two of them then began to trying to defend themselves.

Sir yee hua tha and this that so the two of them started giving justification.

M- i acted clueless and oblivious lik I WAS NEVER EVEN IN CLASS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

I was afraid he will tell sir i am the culprit but you know sir nee usse bure trike see dharashahi kr diya so he woasnt in a state where he can peak or understand and e was nice person so he will not directly take a stance and put whole blame on me. His spine wanst that strong.

I lied ofcourse.

A realisation hit me that i have very nice tactical advantage, the same reason sir didn't hit me immediately.

 I was a quiet kid who didnt spoke much, i didnt knew what sir is saying or teahcing most of the time so just turning to air and sitting at angles where  kids in front will block sir from seeing me.

kartikey and devansh was exactly type of person who looked like and will do this thing the behind two were i guess are known by sir as naughty kids so. They were known as naught kids by teachers. I was to part of group but

i was the most innocent cause i gave of an aura of more of an shy/coward and i was most of the times in gloomy mood.

Seeing how sir is paying attention and improtance to word and his attitude towards 

 So for someone like me doing something like this may feel little like out of character by the image he has of me. So maybe i can act all inocent and escape and not face any consequences at all

You can greed or cowardice welling up in me but 

I tried to shift the time scale from the present incident of me and shubhankar laughing to little back in time 

And tolhat is by telling sir few instances of how they were trying to pull prank on us in his period with little exaggeration and mixing.

I realised that i can get away with this and not get any punishment and save myself from embarrasment in front of my parents. It's supereasy to turn these pigs into sacrifices. My strategy was not to drag as many people as i can with em. All cards were in my favour

 ( i forgot to factor in shubhankar everything was moving too fast)

I knew that i just have to stand confident nd with an oblivious look that i don't what they are talking about.

When they tried to defend themselves, and i just barely managed to put on an serious expression  and put points in front of sir but i don't bother replying with them cause 

None of their justification and words ei have any value as long as i don't say something.

i knew that as long as i stood serious, confident and have a face like i am standing here for justice no matter how strongly they defend themselves i will be the winner but the only probelm was my friend who was lying on ground.

The story i told sir was the two at the back were making us laugh..i had 100% confidence in victory cause  i can turn kartikey and devansh into scapegoat 

Easily himself with other two.

(Earlier strategy was to drag as many people as i can with em but now as i see hoppe of putting all blame on them and escape unscathered by acting innocent i just gave in to cowardice. I have been coward since childhood. 

(Shubhankar got beaten for no reason when e explain his side, i will damned even more. 

He was nice person and i knew with he personality i can push him and currently the topic was not what happened in present but their shenanigans in sirs middle when he was teaching so i just have mush him and make him say yes in yes and not allow them to influence hin)

 I have to act first so i said to sir ask from shubhankar. I moved to shubhankar and helped him get up and said to him in Hindi that in sst period the two of them were trying to pinch us from behind and even the incidents before that.

Yes yes say to sir yes

He ddidnt knew what was happening here so it would be easy for me to make him say yes but.

I knew he won't be satisfied until he see the real culprit me getting beaten so i dont know what i am even doing.

i can make him say that they were trying to poke is with 

shubhankar he was something who i consider real friend.

Wo dono abhi tk bhot has rhe thee show dekhkr pr yee sunte hi wo dono bokhla gye.  

(Now our circle was the group of troublemaker in the whole classroom and in sst sir period i tried to just act like a sincere silent kid who doesn't speak much i always tried portraying that image so that dir wouldn't make me standup and answer his questions cause most of the time i didn't know what he was speaking, so i can't answer question or even if i knew what he was saying by the time i will translate my points into English a lot of time already would have passed and it was Evermore difficult to do that while class was looking at you. I dont have any intention to become laughing stock.) 

ISir yee jhut bhol rha hain 

The two of them begin to say he is lying.

AND THE TWO OF THEM STARTED EXPLAINING THEMSELVES

THEY WERE

I was confident that i can easily turn them into scapegoat

But problem was if shubhankar main hain bhr deng

dega to phir sayad wo back jaaye aur 3-4x aaur suutiye hon. Saaith main yee tino mere see dusmani ki mod lenge

Since their words had no weight thanks to my reaction and sirs image. 

Sir turned and asked me.

I was in tough spot 

I have already thought about answer to say but problem was what i thought was in Hindi and i had to convert it into English.

Kds of class were surrounding us in a circle for entertainment.

I somehow managed to say

They were pinching us (i wanted to say they were trying to  pinch us with pen ' but saying it will do my bezzati)

It was momentary silemt

Sir was looking and trying to understand what to do.

Now my dead friend was getting up from his sleep and i was scared that if

Sir asked him what happened?

Or kartike asked him who was the one responsible?

And he got beaten up for my problem so he has more than enough reason to want me to meet the same fate he did 

So i was thinking, that i will go to him shake him and say 

Yee dono 4th period main hame preshan krrhe thee na?

Wo meri pushiness ki wajah see soch nhi payga aur ha khega 

Luckily it was my day.

There was a cap upside down on my bench.

(In that time there was one prank which was famous.

Placing the cap of your pen on the other person bench and they will sit on it.

Sir picked up the cap, he looked at the two monkeys who were sitting on behind desk, they looked at sir.)

The two of them had a short exchange of words

jb tk sir nee undono kee saaith pyaar baata.

Auur un tinno ko miln dekh kr me phir see hsne lga 

Sir was in mood of sutai so he pulled them to him and started giving them tol a good beating.

At that time all kids were standing in a jhund to see the drama it was( lunchtime)

The two of them recieved multiple slaps and even before my turn was about to come 5-6 teachers from different classes.

I knew i was going to sahid . Our school was really really strict. It was one of the strictest school in Bareilly and they used to normally reatigate students ver easily.

But luckily they spared our lives. They didn't allowed us to eat lunch and asked us to stand outside with our bag in head.

The three of them stopped talking to me saying i am chalak , but they forget things fastly and lives go on.

Now our class was directly above principal 

SIr asked us to put bag on our top and raise hands (The amount of book i used to bring was really low and i sliped out few more copies when i had the chances). I was standing there with great pride and still the happiness was just not leaving my soul. Apparently the three of them were talking that if principal sir wiere to come they all will point their fingers at me. But at this point i just have lost that sense of fear. I was just enjoying the breeze that was flowing. I think that was the happiest moment in my wasteful 9th class.               

I was a good obedient child so he had some resistance in hitting me.

That is when he noticed that the kids sitting on bench back of me have placed a pens cap on my seat so that when i will sit on  seat it will pinch me. It was common  prank among stuents.

Sir redirectreted te frustration he had over me to them.

Teachers from other classes came they surrounded all four of us and were

Saying things like ‘ÁAj kaall ke bacho maain koi respect nhi’  blah blah

And i was literally just trying to control laugh.

Sir kicked us out of class and didnt allowed  us lnch but that didnt mattered much

I joined 

First one was shubhankar the perosn

 whom i sat with and the 3rd member was kartikey i wanted to kick him out but he was really stubborn, forceful and he will comeback.

He had really thorny, jealous and poky attitude.

 i had bitternes and anger against him but my pride doesnt allowed me to show him that i hade anger against him actively cause i saw anger as sign of weakness of character 

 showed him . I wanted to show him the impression that he is just dirty pig in my view that i want to stay away from.

There is background story behind it so it will take little longer if you want me to explain or should I continue with the orignal story cause you only needed to know that i have hatred

On way of getting off bus throwing water

One time throw water on devrath or kunal or

Sumo having fun with her friends spill

Ayush Throwing Daily Going Home Watery Normal

In exams time, ayush water throwing even more fun

…………………………………………………

Grm

School strict i consider myself ver coward but they were fatoo, maybe city ke bache jyada tamed hote hai, i have now realized 

I want to give but of background information so that it won't break flow of story later. (Don't give too much info dumb inbeginning just short intro and start you can dump info slowly slowly as you getter deeper into story and add points at right place)

It was 4th period sst class and i was feeling extremely hungry.

There was lunch after this and then again the boring sst period i despised with my soul .

Only thing that was giving me strength to endure the suffering/sleepiness was the anticipation for lunch.

I wanted to eat lunch in class but it was i couldn't because of 2-3 reasons:---

i was on the leftest row ( !  !❗) And on that on the side next to middle row. I was at back but it was still Place where teacher can directly see my bag and even there

i could have sneaked up and eat but problem was there were lot of attention-seeking pigs  in class. They will tell sir and will laugh like pigs they were.

I have to tell little background information about the group i sat with. 

our group was the group of three friends and we were the most harami/ wildness  kids in class so all teachers knew us.

So almost all the teacher knew us very and we we had synergy with most of teacher. So teachers were really friendly and tecahers and us too will joke around with teacher.

I want to give but of background information so that it won't break flow of story later.

It was 4th period sst class and i was felling sleepy as always. Our sst sir was somewhere from Tamil Nadu/Goa/karnatka it all was same to me. So he spoke in only pure English. In that age except Indian english or English spoken with full clarity the precise type , i needed subtitle to understand otherwise i will miss lot of words and it was really tiresome cause i have to give my full attention to comprehend and it was really painfully and boring. So i will try to listen and understand what sir is  but i will start to feel super sleepy. None of my classmates faced this problem and some even thought of him as funny and they will laugh during his class multiple times on his jokes but i just felt like an alien. cause they might have more familiarity than me cause i was new in this school and joined it this year only.

Only thing that was giving me strength to endure the suffering/sleepiness was the anticipation for lunch.

I wanted to eat lunch in class but it was my unlucky because i was on the leftest row ( !  !❗) And on that on the side next to middle row. I was at back but it was still Place where teacher can directly see my bag and even there i could have sneaked up and eat but problem was there were lot of chugalkhor in class. They will tell sir and will laugh like pigs they were .

group i sat with. 

our group was the group of most harami kids in class and if you create a tally of who gets punished or scolded or teacher tookte thee

So lot of 

The perosn who sat Next to me sat my friend Shubhankar, he was the very funny, charming and nice person. Teachers liked him but at the same time he used get scolded and punishment for the shenanigans.

So sir used to get extra attention to our group 

So sir

 and he will crack lot of jokes and sir will to 

PTM sir said to their parents and my parents

Mene bcche bigaad diye they are going in gutter only after meeting me

English sir told my mom that me, kartike, shubhankar sit back in class and abuse, make fun of teacher and create names. Yee baat unhe kisi baache ne report ki thi.

I was new in school, so sir assumed that mene unhe bigad Diya aur mere ek dost ki mummy see shikayat nhi krdi.

And before that i have always been a sanskari bachha to mummy. Time he homework krne, mummy papa ki baate manna, blah blah.

I was still half good i still believed that teachers are these noble/holy creature so i can delfile these beings by saying something abusive or even just calling out names. 

And i had it subconsciously ingrained in me that gaalis are bad and i would just rarely say them to fight in bezzati battle in hm dost ek dusri ki lete thee.

I still remeber it deeply disappointment in mom words when she said.

"Tumse yee ummid nhi thi"

Always before i have been sanskari kid and mummy ka aacha bcha

Tecaher will praise me for sincerity in all PTM

First i was just finding it difficult to comprehend what is happening cause this will paint an dark spot in my pure image.

I was feeling so much shame and that numbing sensation.

What sir told mom was clearly a lie but that numbness due to shame and heavy atmosphere was making it difficult for me to breathe and just think or say anything.

I began to cry and said sir is lying it's the other two who are bad.

Then mom later asked me not to sit with them.

But i felt mom didn't fully believed in me and it hurted me a lot 

I rarely lied to my mom, so it felt bad that i used half lie.

And this incident Gandhi laughing incident will worsen my image

I followed her suit and didn't say with them but school felt so boring.

Un dono ke aalawa kisi mein utni wildness nhi thi aur agar khud see baith kar class main aaram see mumfalli khana chaho, to koi bcha 

'Sir sir agrim momfalli kha rha hain' krne LG jaynge

Ab aaisa behaviour chota bacho main shi lgta hain .

Dhmkana chaho class ke baad

Ki kya chul mch rhi hain

Khud aaram see the mujhe aaram see rhne do. 

Wo bhi wo teacher ko bta dega 

Koi problem hain to bolo, gali do, fight kro apne liye,  tecaher ki kyu chatni hain

 Kids in stanford were very supportive.. They wont give the names even when forced. Example - in class8th i was screaming something bad to a friend of mine and it was loud enough that sir heard it. Sir came and ask who was it and madew everyone in class standup. I was scared as fuck but sir just repeted question and noone gave any answer so sir just went away. 

I didn't fear getting beaten, that is temporary pain only probelm was mom dad.

Next period after lunch too was sst.

Sst threw us out again after he allowed d to eat lunch after sometime g lunch has pussed 

Sir was supposed to ask us questions so i got freedom from.that too.

I remeber i wasstanding outside g class. I was at little distance from my other two pyare mitro (sweet friends) see halki duri pe khda tha yaa wo khudo mere see duri pe rkh Rhee the. Wo dono aapas me khusfusa rhe thee ki

'agar ab principal aaya to agrim ka naam lekar usse pitwayenge'

I was just laughing. That was a drought filled year of life so i was really grateful for shower .

Shubhankar was happy go lucky type so he will not hold grudges, they almost forgot about it. But time to time mention krenge, I

Let me give you little information about group dynamics. We were group of 3 friends but i don't saw them as friends and thought of them as fake friends and now the entire story is big and divergent from the incident i am trying to tell, so let me tell you in short and only relevant parts to the this story.

Incident is of 9th class and i joined the new school in 9th class.

It was a really strict and rigid school. It emphasised a lot on discipline.

They will send a call to parents for even s stuffs and you will hear news of someone getting suspend often so kids of class had submissive attitude towards the rules of school. 

And i thought of it as very annoying.

in my previous school all kids had an rebelliousess/ wildness/ refusal-to-get-tame attitude 'kys bigaad lenge' towards teachers and everyone and because of that class was alway lively and almost everyday something intersting happened that i found it was worth to come to school today but here everything felt so monotonous, dull, barren.

(Later when i was depressed, this memory twisted and u began to perceive it as a proof there is something wrong with me)

And the kids i talk i found all of them boring beacuse our  valuee never matched.

Also also the class already had cliques and groups

But in this barren wasteland 

I wish it will be nice if i can become friends with them but in class cliques were already formed. It's easily to befriend a lone perosn and then become friends but joining a group has more nuances (power dynamics) in it. 

And if i have to enter group in smoothest way then

First understand who hold the power in the group. Find him when he is alone and build friendship and with that it is easy to mesh into group but i just gave up cause it was impossible task.

If i Dont enter in group right way then they may try to use me as laughing stock and what judgemnet will they have towards me.

One day in art class i was solving maths questions clas11 i joined unacadwmy. And the duo of subhankar and kartikey. They were apparently bestfriends. They  talked to be and we became friends instantly.

First i slowly slowly developed closed friendship with kartikey.

Kartikey was very competitive and ambitious person, so i was preparing for iit early and i was able to convert him easily.

Shubhankar was not at all competitive, he was happy-go-lucky type of person and he didn't cared about such things that much.

I understood that so i thought okay, 

Kartikey and I studied together and talked a lot about maths and physics. It was fun.

He told he wished he got an impetus before it would have been nice. Now kartikey wanted well being of shubhankar and he wanted that he too get in good iit. So he shouldn't waste time and study together with us. I kind of gave up in putting too much care about shubhankar but he cared about him, so he tried motivating him, when it didn't work. He tried belittling and he was overindulgent in belittling him but it all to get angry and start but his attempts failed but due to his bellittle, their friendship wasn't as good as before cause the same person was someone he used to call bestfriend but now he don't care about him that much cuz we talked about physics and maths. And he is making fun of him sometimes to motivate him and othertimes to feed ones ego cause there is certain pleasure in making fun of others. 

 bu wet our ego rub resulted in us always fighting and friendship became thorny. 

So i began to talk and sit more with shubhankar and then he became my close friend. 

Kartikey thlught that i deliberately make the two of them lose touch with each other's and had broken their close friendship out of jealously i feel towards him.

 So i was frustated and bored 

Also in the beginning i was not able to form close friendship with someone.

I was not able to find anyone in class who shared same value as me so i was finding everyone boring but it was something i thought 

thought maybe something is wrong with me 

I thought it was okay to make him suffer cause he is bad

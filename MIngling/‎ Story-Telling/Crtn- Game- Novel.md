I think what i wanted to make is so grand that its so grand.
and for that i will have to learn making music, vfx, 3d modelling, animation, game development.,
YOUTUBE wasn’t as big wide and lot of creators
BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT for me to find COURSES from which i can learn


I don’t understand technical knowledge/language
People from programming/CSE background.
I don’t have mental frameworks
THINK OF IT like how it will be 7th class student to learn universty physics not even by books but QUESTIONs 
Nor my English is so great for me to get everything explained.
I needed subtitles to understand, adn even in that i can know what is they are trying to talk about BUT 
When you are trying to understand a complex thing everything is important.
**It’s almost like, as a 12yr old, i am trying to learn Chinese through an French teacher** and teaching college students who are doing C.S.
Game development is **THE MOST COMPLEX & HARDEST PROGRAMMING**


(Nanaji in bihar in govt school from very poor, got full marks, in that time getting 80%+ was topper, he was poor didn’t had any good teachers 


( i never focused much on vocabulary developing english, i can barely understand & trying to understand a complex  )

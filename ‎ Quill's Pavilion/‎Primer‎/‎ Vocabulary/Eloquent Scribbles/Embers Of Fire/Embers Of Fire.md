Welp, I did it
I could have done so many more productive things
but instead
I wrote an entire Italian voice piece
with raelly stupid lyrics


You are good.
You’ve just defeated a state level champion.
Don’t be disheartened buddy.
You’ve just lost to national level champion.


In a  town who has never seen a girl wrestle when a girl wrestles a boy  how mnay people willl come to watch? Our competiton will go through the roof

Even if you were to pit your boys against lions there still wouldn't have been such a crowd.    




In addition to **keeping an eye** on dosage

Are you asking or telling me?

Mariam really **disliked** ~~hated~~ Nana talking this way about jalil (hated ain’t appropitate too strong Nana is her mother BROO!!!)

**Oh I’m sorry i don’t really know haha.**
Okay **(by the looks of it)/**(~~it looks like your~~) account may be frozen for suspicious activity involving it. You may need to confirm your identify to resecure your a mojang account for minecraft. 
**Well i guess that answers that hahaha**

You can actually call MrBeast, Appraently there’s an option call “call” i don’t what it means but seems (too personal for my taste)/(Bit intimate for my taste)

This has lot of potential… and it also **illustrates** ~~shows~~ importance of an ancient Neolithic invention: the wheel.

Are you intending to live in the UK long term or is the wanderlust calling you.


**Just did a quick check.** Not seeing any Ralph Stewart in my employee catalogue. We do have a Steward Raphson working in Tesla relations. **That must be you then?**

Is it a good idea to remove bullets **lodged** in your arms

(~~I don’t fucking care~~ - cuz it shows you care)

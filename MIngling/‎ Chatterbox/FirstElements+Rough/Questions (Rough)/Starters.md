CONVERSATION TIPS

-   Make sure to ask lots of follow up questions related to their answers. But remember it’s a conversation, not an interrogation. So when they ask you a question, make sure to give a long detailed answer and answer any follow up questions they ask you. Every conversation should be a give and take of talking and listening.
-   There are some people who might just not feel like talking. Remember, if someone gives you a lot of one word answers, doesn’t make eye contact, and doesn’t ask you any questions; that probably means they aren’t in the mood for a conversation. In that case it’s better to just end the conversation and leave them to their own thoughts.
-   Keep the majority questions [open-ended](https://conversationstartersworld.com/open-ended-questions/). This will make it more likely to get answers that have a lot of detail so that you can ask follow up questions. If most of your questions are [closed-ended](https://conversationstartersworld.com/closed-ended-questions-3/) you’ll end up getting lots of yes, no, and one word answers.

TOPICS TO GET THE CONVERSATION STARTED

These are your run of the mill, first meeting someone, topics to talk about. Your [ice breakers](https://conversationstartersworld.com/icebreaker-questions/). You’ll find that most people will have at least some things to say about each of these topics.

Once you stumble upon something interesting or something they are interested in, keep talking about that for a while. Branch off from your initial topic and ask follow up questions about whatever they seem interested in. Usually people like talking about themselves, so it’s usually good to focus on them and be a good listener with occasional prompting follow up questions.

1. Current situation

Usually the best way to start a conversation is to talk about your current situation. The questions you’ll ask vary greatly on where you are and what you are doing.

So for example, if you are waiting for something you might ask how long they’ve been waiting. Or if you are at a show or an event you might ask if they’ve seen the performer or speaker before.

They are getting better and better, but are they getting better in the way you want them to? What features would you like to see in the next round of phones?

Phones, it’s often a love-hate relationship. Now you can both complain about your phones. Together!

146. What was your first smartphone? How did you feel when you got it?

Whether young or old. You’ll always remember your first.

147. Do you experience phantom vibration? (Feeling your phone vibrate even though it didn’t.)

SPORTS CONVERSATION STARTERS

Sports! There’s a reason it’s one of the most popular conversation topics.

148. What sports do you like to watch?

Try to find one that you both have in common, or you both follow. Once you find it, the rest of the conversation will flow naturally.

If you are into sports, you have favorite athletes. Find out who their favorite athletes are and why they like them.

This one is pretty debatable. The case could be made for plenty of sports. Give this question a go and see if you both agree.

152. Who are the 3 greatest athletes of all time?

Another one that you can debate a lot about. Probably easiest to pick a sport to narrow it down first, though.

153. How much time do you spend watching sports in a week?

This one probably depends a lot on their favorite sport, and the season it’s played in. Or they might just be super into sports. Or they might not like sports. But if they don’t like sports, then why are you talking to them about sports?

154. Do athletes deserve the high salaries they receive? Why or why not?

This one can be a little contentious at times. But it should lead to a lively conversation no matter what side of the coin they fall on.

155. What defines a sport? Is fishing a sport? How about video game tournaments?

This one can lead to an excellent conversation because everyone has an opinion, and all the opinions are on a sliding scale. There is definitely a limit on what someone will consider a sport.

156. Do you play in any fantasy sports leagues? If so, how into fantasy sports are you?

There a lot of people who are REALLY into fantasy sports. If the person you are talking to is into it, they are more than happy to have a conversation about their team.

This is a little deeper than the normal sports question. But it can lead to an interesting conversation about human nature with a bit of a sports spin.

If they like sports, there is a good chance they play some kind of video game involving sports. Even if it is just an app on their phone.

How close to the food poisoning sun do you want to fly, Icarus?

169. What is the most disgusting thing you have heard happened at a restaurant?

If you’ve traveled to any popular destinations, you may have come across this. So much hype. But a big letdown once you get there.

179. Have you traveled to any different countries? Which ones?

Depending on what country you are both from the answers to this question vary a lot. Are you in the US? You might find most people haven’t left the country or have just been to one or two other countries. Asking in Europe? You’ll probably get a ton of travel stories about different countries.

180. Where is the most awe-inspiring place you have been?

This is great for getting new travel ideas for yourself. And if you’ve been there, you can talk about your experience too.

181. What’s the best thing about traveling? How about the worst thing?

Again, this will vary a lot based on who you are talking to and how they travel. But chances are they have pretty strong feelings about both questions.

So many bad hotels out there. Get ready for some horror stories about gross stuff. Or you know, a tip about a sweet hotel you can try. It depends on how the conversation goes.

183. How do you think traveling to a lot of different countries changes a person?

186. Where do you get your recommendations for what to do and where to stay when you travel?

Is it from fellow travelers, guidebooks, the internet, social media, or a combination?

TECHNOLOGY CONVERSATION STARTERS

Tech, some hate it, and some love it, but even those who love it probably have a love/hate thing going on with it. Either way, it makes for some great conversation questions!

187. What is your favorite piece of technology that you own?

Let’s start it out positive and see what kind of tech they rely on.

188. What piece of technology is really frustrating to use?

And now, let’s look at the dark side of tech when it just doesn’t work the way we want it to. Probably a lot more to talk about in this question than the previous one.

189. What was the best invention of the last 50 years?

Lots of good answers to this one. You both will probably come up with quite a few contenders. And it can be fun to debate the merits of each.

190. Does technology simplify life or make it more complicated?

This one sometimes leads to an interesting conversation about tech and modern life, but if the person lands hard on one side or the other usually there isn’t much more to talk about.

191. Will technology save the human race or destroy it?

So, this is a pretty heavy question that you don’t want to drop in casual conversation. It’s better left for conversations with people you know quite well, or folks who you know are into this type of question.

192. Which emerging technology are you most excited about?

There is a lot of promising tech fields that seem like they are just on the horizon. So which ones are you looking forward to? And perhaps which make you a little uneasy?

This is similar to the emerging technologies question, but this one isn’t about playing favorites, but about which will arrive first.

195. What technology from a science fiction movie would you most like to have?

CLOTHES / FASHION CONVERSATION STARTERS

Conversation questions about clothes are always in fashion.

199. What is your favorite shirt?

Whether it’s for comfort, style, or just an exceptionally clever or funny t-shirt, everyone has a favorite.

200. Does fashion help society in any way?

This is a bit philosophical but can be a fun one to discuss. If the person seems into deeper conversations, you could give this one a go.

201. What old trend is coming back these days?

It seems that fashion always pulls from the past. Whether it’s coloring, types of clothes, or just the general style of a past decade. So, which past fashion trends are they pulling from currently?

This can be the start of a fun conversation about the ridiculous fashions that have come and gone in recent decades.

Some people care a lot about fashion, some don’t, and some care a lot but pretend that they don’t. Which one are they?

207. If you didn’t care at all what people thought of you, what clothes would you wear?

It might be what they are currently wearing, or it might be something totally different. It all depends on how well their ideal clothing matches current trends. It’s always fun, though, if the person is into cosplay or period clothing.

208. What is the best pair of shoes you have ever owned? Why were they so good?

Comfortable shoes that look good are a rare find. You might just get some good tips on a new pair of kicks.

209. Who do you think has the biggest impact on fashion trends: actors and actresses, musicians, fashion designers, or consumers?

This sounds like a question from a fashion textbook, but it can actually often lead to some thoughtful answers and a good conversation.

GOALS CONVERSATION STARTERS

Let’s talk about goooooooooaaaaaaaaals!

210. What personal goals do you have?

Some people are a little cagey about their personal goals, and some are pretty open to sharing them. Just don’t make this one the first question you ask a person. Best to get to know them a bit better before popping this one.

211. What are your goals for the next two years?

Similar to the last one, but this one is a little more specific and deals with midterm goals rather than long term goals.

212. How have your goals changed over your life?

Oh, I guarantee your and their goals have changed quite a bit from 10 or 20 years ago. It’s always fun to talk about goals from the past.

213. How much do you plan for the future?

The answers to this one vary a lot from person to person. And it’s a great one to find out if they are spur of the moment or more methodical.

214. How do you plan to make the world a better place?

Some people have a solid plan, some don’t care, and some, it seems, are actively trying to make the world a worse place. Find out where on the spectrum the person you are talking lands.

215. What are some goals you have already achieved?

This one is pleasant because they get to talk about their successes. And even if they are humble, they probably still enjoy having their successes recognized.

216. What do you hope to achieve in your professional life?

Switching over from personal goals, now it’s time for a conversation about professional goals.

217. Have your parents influenced what goals you have?

For some, it might be a positive influence; for others the pressures might have pushed them in the opposite direction. Either way, this is a pretty personal question so make sure you know the person pretty well before asking them this question.

218. Do you usually achieve the goals you set? Why or why not?

Again, kind of personal, and can often lead to some bummer conversations, so be wary of this one. Make sure you know the person before asking this one.

219. What is the best way to stay motivated and complete goals?

Moving on from personal questions and kind of bummer questions, this one is looking more on the bright side of life. And you might get some good suggestions to help you achieve your own goals.

220. What are some goals you have failed to accomplish?

Whoops back into negative territory, while it can lead to a good conversation, just be cognizant of how the conversation might turn with this question.

221. What is the craziest, most outrageous thing you want to achieve?

This one is always a fun one to ask. Sometimes the person has to think a while, and sometimes they already have it lined up. But however long it takes them to answer, the answer is usually a really good one.

222. When do you want to retire? What do you want to do when you retire?

I like this question because it gets to the point of what they really want to be doing. Not what they have to be doing. You can find out a lot about a person by learning what they want to do when they aren’t obligated to be doing anything in particular.

SEASONS CONVERSATION STARTERS

There is a time for everything. A time to sow and a time to reap. And a time to discuss seasons!

223. Do you prefer summer or winter activities?

Fun in the sun or ummm.. furlough in the snow? There is probably a better rhyme than that, but for now, furlough will have to do. So, which is their jam, snow skiing or water skiing?

224. What do you like to do in the spring?

Whether it’s hiking or just sitting on the porch, the dawn of spring is always a pleasant time of year.

225. Did your family take seasonal vacations?

Don’t forget to follow up by asking where they would go if they answer yes to this one. Not everyone was lucky enough to be able to take vacations when they were younger, but if they were it’s always fun to hear about them.

226. Which do you prefer, fall or spring?

Both are pretty amazing, and both have some really good things going for them. But probably you and the person you are talking with have a strong preference one way or the other.

227. Which season are you most active in?

Because the seasons are so different depending on where you live, the answers to this one vary a lot from region to region. See if you and the person you are talking to agree.

228. What’s the most refreshing thing on a hot summer day?

Whether it’s a dip in the pool, a glass of fresh lemonade, an ice-cold beer, or something else entirely, it’s always fun to talk about the things that make us go “Ahhhhh.”

229. What’s the best thing to do on a cold winter day?

Indoors or out? Fun or warming? Lots of different ways you could go with this conversation starter.

230. Where is the nicest place you have been to in fall?

The leaves changing, the crisp air, there is something so invigorating about fall. I’m sure you have a favorite place, even if it is just a bench in a nice park.

231. What is your favorite thing to eat or drink in winter?

So much warm and delicious things to eat and drink in winter, it’s pretty hard to decide. Don’t feel like you have to choose just one!

232. Is it better to live where there are four seasons or where one season takes up most of the year?

I imagine this one depends on where you live. Lots of people want what they don’t have. So, my guess is that if where you live has four seasons you probably want to live somewhere with a long summer. But feel free to test out my hypothesis with this question!

HOLIDAY CONVERSATION STARTERS

Time to celebrate with some holiday conversations!

233. What is the biggest holiday for your family?

Whether holidays usually end up being a big disaster or not, there is probably at least one holiday where their family goes all out.

Whether it’s a traditional one or a newer one, everyone has a favorite. Don’t forget to ask them why it’s their favorite, as well.

235. What holidays have been over-commercialized?

“All of them” is a totally viable answer, but this is a good steppingstone into talking about the topic in general as well as some of the newer holidays that seem to be popping up.

236. Do you wish there were more or fewer holidays? Why?

So, there are a TON of “holidays” out there. But there could always be more, or different ones, or less. Or even better yet more holidays where you can take off from work or school. Those are always fun.

237. What do you know about the history of some holidays?

The traditional holidays have some buck wild history to them. We’ve got some [trivia pages](https://conversationstartersworld.com/trivia-questions/) on the site that go into some of the history behind a few popular holidays. You can find the links to those pages below.

238. What kinds of food do you usually eat on your favorite holiday?

It wouldn’t be a holiday without food! And every holiday tends to have its own flavors. So, find out what is traditional for them and their family and see how it compares to your traditions.

239. If you had to get rid of a holiday, which would you get rid of? Why?

There are definitely some holidays that could use a bit of pruning, rebranding, or just be outright replaced. Looking at you, Columbus Day. With this question you can find out which holidays they aren’t a fan of.

240. Does having a day off for a holiday increase or decrease productivity at work?

Sure, you might think that with a day off, productivity might decrease, but happy employees do tend to get more done. So, does it even out? Now you both can weigh in and decide together.

241. If some of the lesser-known holidays were commercialized, what would the commercialization look like?

If you can’t think of some of the lesser-known holidays, you can [check out this page](https://nationaltoday.com/). So many unofficial and official holidays. So many.

242. If you could make a holiday, what would it be like? What traditions would it have? What would people eat on your holiday?

EDUCATION CONVERSATION STARTERS

Sharpen your pencils. It’s time for an education conversation.

243. What do you think of online education?

Whether it be online courses for schools, Khan Academy, or tutorials on YouTube there is lots of education happening online. If the person you are talking to is into education this is a rich vein for conversations.

244. What do you think of standardized tests?

Love them or hate them, they are an entrenched part of the school system. You could talk about possible improvements, how effective or ineffective they are, and if there are any viable alternatives.

245. Are bigger or smaller schools better?

Most people will agree that small class sizes are better. But how about the whole school? What are the pros and cons of a small or a big school?

246. Is teaching a skill that can be taught?

Are good teachers born, or are they created? Are there any inherent traits that might make a person more likely to be a good teacher? This one is a good pool of possible conversations to dive into.

247. What will the future of education be?

Who doesn’t love some fortune-telling? See if your idea of the future of education matches up with their prediction. What would be the best outcome? What is the most likely outcome?

248. What do you think of homeschooling?

Homeschooling is becoming more and more popular. And with anything, it has pros and cons. Whether you are for or against, it’s a great topic for those who are interested in education.

249. How can governments make education more efficient?

Because if there is one thing I’ve learned, it’s that people are totally happy with the public-school system and there is no room for improvement.

250. How has the education you received changed your life?

And if you don’t think it’s changed your life in any way, just imagine having no education, and you can see the impact of education.

251. How can technology improve education? Can it hurt education?

As with anything involved with technology, the use of technology in the classroom is hotly debated. Most want more, some want less. What kind of technology would you like to see put into the classroom, and is there any you would want to be taken out?

252. What or who has taught you most of the information you use regularly?

Is it school, friends, family, the internet? We pull information from lots of sources. Which do you think is the best source for good information?

253. What are some good and bad things about the education system in your country?

This kind of brings all the previous questions together in a big whopper of a question. Get ready for a long conversation with this question.

FOOD CONVERSATION STARTERS

Whether they are a foodie or not, everyone has to eat, and that makes it a great topic to have a conversation about.

254. What is your favorite cuisine or type of food?

Everyone has a favorite type of food, whether it be international or local. And even if it is international cuisine, there is probably a local spin to it. This question transitions nicely into what their favorite foods are.

255. What foods do you absolutely hate?

Everyone has foods they can’t stand. And they usually like talking about why they hate them so much!

256. What do you think of buffets?

With this one, you might have to consider how the person might take it. If they are a little on the heavier side, they might think you are making a comment about their weight. Just a heads up, so you don’t offend anyone accidentally.

257. When was the last time you had a food fight?

Who doesn’t love a good food fight? Well, I guess anyone who doesn’t want food on their clothes… or anyone who doesn’t like wasting food…  but still they can be fun.

258. What food looks disgusting but tastes delicious?

There are so many foods out there that are like this. My guess is that you can think of a couple off the top of your head, and I bet whoever you are talking to can as well!

259. What do you get every time you go grocery shopping?

We all have that one snack or treat that we just can’t get enough of. And who knows you might just find your next favorite snack by asking this question.

Definitely a weird one. But it can be fun depending on how creative you both get with it. The fun is in the explanation of why it would be that kind of meal.

261. What would you want your last meal to be if you were on death row?

What’s the perfect meal to go out on?

Don’t worry, I think we all do. And probably the person you are talking to has one as well.

263. Do you like spicy food? Why or why not? What is the spiciest thing you have ever eaten?

And have you seen some of the videos of people eating spicy food or peppers? Whew, some of those look really painful, especially when they wipe tears away, and it gets in their eyes. Ouch.

264. Does the government have a place in regulating food? To what extent should government regulate food?

This can definitely get political, so fair warning you may want to avoid this one if you don’t want to get into a conversation about politics and regulation.

265. When people make mistakes about food (especially foreign food), do you feel the need to correct them?

Some people like to know when they get something wrong, and some definitely don’t. Are you one of the people that gets annoyed when someone corrects you about food, or do you appreciate being corrected?

266. If your mind were an island, what would it look like?

Put your Dante hat on and get to creating!

Yeah, I know there was a lame movie about this. But it is still a pretty cool hypothetical.

274. If you could call up anyone in the world and have a one-hour conversation, who would you call?

You could learn something from them by asking questions, you could try to convince them to do something or not do something, or you could just try to befriend them.

275. The world has become infested with rabid dogs with the intelligence of a 5-year-old, where do you hole up to survive the “a-pup-calypse”?

I’m not sure if this has been made into a really cheesy horror film, but if it hasn’t, it should be.

276. A portal to another world opens in front of you. You don’t know how long it will stay open or if you’ll be able to get back after you go through. What do you do?

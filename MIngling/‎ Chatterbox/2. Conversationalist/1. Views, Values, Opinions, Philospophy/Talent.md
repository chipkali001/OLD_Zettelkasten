Talent is about exploration and not being best in the field.
When someone chart out dungeon properly explorer sint needed.
Noone has charted out properly so explorer has value.
Learning itself is exploration and since noone has developed structures for it.
It is unknown and exploration.
I think i define talent as an intution an innate guide.
With story listen to me. Try to understand why i wish to convey
Let's say in an parallel world where noone.knows how to swim, someone just naturally just learned how to swim.
Do you think he will be the best swimmer really the best swimmer?
Others saying or his body special or something brain special is all stupid.

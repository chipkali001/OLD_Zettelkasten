Father character buildup and use.

First goofy man
Child Taunt
Get’s looted does nothing
Child angry
Makes game for SON
SON inauguration plays with name LUCIFER
SON loves adores, father everyone is happy
Ra. one comes outside to fight LUCIFER
When onway back dad.
He tells raoone he is lucifer
Ra. one - you’re lying
Kills father
Father robot contained relics and his wisdom last words: Burai sang joh mel rachaya ... phir kabhi na chutte uska saaya


Father Character attachment develop
cuz SHOWS SUFFERING (a pure person, not dark person)
he is facing rejcection ager maltreatment from OWN KIDS, COLLEGUES, BOSS
Further weakness accentuated by him not fighting and kid saying.
RESOLUTION (temporal & we know something is about to go awry so it prevents viewers from getting too attached to resolution) - Kid game try - then says love u to father later after playing.
**Self-Sacrifice (with noone knowing ever or noticing that he sacrificed)**

Make users wanna people he know to acknowledge his sacrifice.
> [!Attention] Adjustment to make this trope
> 1. Making people still think BAD, FUN of HIM - totally unaware of his sacrifice. Make viewers want people for which MC seld-sacrified to know REALITY 
> 2. Use advantage of viewer ATTACHMENT to WHAT’S LAST WILL OF ONE WHO SELF-SACRIFICED. that is PUTTING THE PERSON for whom MC Self-sacrificed and suffered so much in SUFFERING or DEATH. cuz WE DON’T WANT SELF_SACRIFICE of pure to do to waste

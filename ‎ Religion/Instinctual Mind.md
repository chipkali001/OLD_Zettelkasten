# My understanding of how brain works by first talking of priming
> [!Attention] What does priming mean?
> To prepare someone/something for particular situation.

Something Simple but Complex - 
let me demonstrate with an story.
Okay, 


**AS WE TALK - way you respond** - you **prime me** & i **prime you w/ way i reveal i piece self**
(Don't make tanuj look weak w/ priming - use MAGICIAN-ENERGY to as )

Priming - to escalate more

Priming - i was very satified (i have been fishing them to fight)
InstinctualMind->WarriorEnergy 
Priming - tanuj image of old meak me SHATTERED

**Their PRIMING** - they came and i attacked them brutally --> that's why anger mask to prime
Priming --> Mam story go even if not CLASS UNITY - so they will DEFEND ME & Stand for me **I WON'T NEED TO SPEAK for MYSELF**
**WARRIOR ENERGY** - Momentum, using body weight, using neck to adjust for max leverage (noone taught me, i had no mental concept of those things) surprise attack - awareness 

**PRIME BREAK THROUGH CORROSION**
1. (Talk of revenge and not attacking again - after you have told MAM-PRIME & KIDS-PRIME to support MY CLAIM )
Priming -> Revenge (that's why i have to act angry and for few days continue --> just to look at them with anger --> **i'm not doing so you stay away** )
2. Priming corrosion break - THEY weren't friends - FRIEND will share different PRIMING - diffeerent way you approach --> Will pretend to forget --> act in super-respectful, compassionate way, show that your respect   --> I'm sorry wo mood mein - tum maar lo  (to intensify you can be like - yaad hain kl bhot bn rhe thee)


STORY TALK OF ONLY - understanding priming
But our clothes & environmetn & poeple you're talking to, their ages - all prime 

Demonstrate by HUNGRY
Let's say super hungry - my thoughts, wau
- First impression MATTERS - might have identified you maybe with an poetry/like-games/anime/... 
- Power Force applies - controls the thought you will have 
Talent - people do as if they are natural - it's you can say they have some divine order - sitting at top - that makes efficient and as if natural connection




## Look not at priming but at his structure
Of an SOMETHING - VERY STRONG - very weighy being on top - that influences YOUR BEHAVIOUR/THOUGHTS/UNDERSTANDING/everything, 



# Conscious VS Unconscious 
**Conscious Mind** - it's our workspace - blackboard - chalk and duster - lacks processing power - can only **run 2-3 task at once.**  - short-term-memory         
**Unconscious Mind** - it controls everything even the conscious mind. 
HOW DID YOU LEARN - LANGUAGE - THE  GRAMMAR

# Instinctual Mind
The Secret
The Power Of Subconsious mind.


Inner for Outer
Outer for Inner --> confirmation bias, try to think ABC car, you'll notice more ABC car, ''



"You are what you think"
"The Secret"
"Be careful what you ask for; you might get it."
"The Subconscious Mind"
**We can access power of** <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">UNCONSIOUS-FORCES</mark> **through IMAGES**

“I got some nice stuff”.  
Matsuda opens his bag, and tips out the things inside his bag without any hesitation.  
The books and DVDs which are being piled up on my desk have suggestivetitles.  
“Hee!”  
A small scream comes from a girl far away from us.  
Well, of course she will react like that. After all, something like this ishappening in the morning.  
What I hear next from the girls are discriminating comments like “You guys are the worst~” and “Die, filthy brats”.  
“Silence! This is our entertainment! Girls and kids should look away and keep away! Or else, I will rape all of you inside my head!”  
Your words are vulgar as always, Matsuda-kun.

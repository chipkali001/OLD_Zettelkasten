Meaning of his words escaped me

I came to realize soon after

I began loosing sight ow what is it i wanted in the first place

I sought out a bond that i was never able to claim for myself.
Not in my life nor in the new one i created.

Good morning to you too, hero makoto... I apologize for the unsightly appearance
Fufufu, you won’t answer me? Then, let me try and guess. Go to a city somewhere and gather forces. Or maybe cross to another country to request their help.” (Nevia)

There's are so many things i have to thank you for and things to apologise for .
I will never forget you. No matter what you will always be in my heart

I feel you scurring inside me like a loathsome parasite.

Ashley came off his cock panting, there were still several strands of saliva that connected her still wide open mouth and tongue to his cock. Her chin and lips her shinny from the mix of precum and spit and the look in her eye was almost indescribable

This perspective arguably lessens the power  that everything has over us. By realizing our meagerness and inexorable interconnectedness with  everything, affected by an unending and continuing line of causality, which we did not and can never  really choose, we become less rigidly attached to what has and will come; we become less anxious  about doing exactly the right or wrong things;  we become less regretful; we become less  scornful; we become more indifferent to  that which we cannot control nor change; we  understand the storms, the lions, the snakes, the people we fear and despise; and finally, we  gain a sense of poise, liberation, and peace.

 that we are no more but no less important; that  everyone and everything is an unchosen part of the whole—a single particle amidst a sea of an eternal  substance of continual motion and reconfiguration. 

"Sorry mom, Nick was tickling me and I was trying to pretend that it had no affect... but it did. Can you please stop now big brother?"

he quickly decided the best plan was to fill Lynn in on his suggestions to their mother. "Move over little sister, I'm sitting with you." He said in a commanding tone walking over to Lynn. "Anything for you big brother!" Lynn said playfully, though Nick also detected a slight seductive tone in her response as well

"I want, what you want little sister." 

When she did she said, "I think I want you to be my first but... I'm not ready yet... is that okay? I'm still a little nervous." Nick smiled and said, "We'll go at your pace little sister, I love you." Lynn beamed and planted a wet kiss right on his lips. They kissed for a few minutes, ignoring the movie completely and Lynn's hands continuing to stroke his shaft. After a while Nick broke this kiss and asked, "Why are you nervous, if you don't mind me asking?"

Again Lynn's motions paused, but once again Nick encouraged her to continue, which she did. "Well, it's like a big deal... it will be my first time... and with my own brother!" 

"I want to watch him fill up your slutty mouth with cum big sister." Lynn said forcefully with a tone like she was talking down to Ashley. 
Nick was surprised, 
Lynn had **always been** sweet and Ashley was **typically described** as bitchy. It was so **weird** yet **incredibly** thrilling to see these rolls reversed in the bedroom. Lynn was being **surprisingly** dominant and Ashley **oddly** accepting of her **subservient** place in this whole act

Okay, so the story for why she waxes down there religiously, is because this one time on a trip to the doctor's, they needed to do something in that area, so they shaved a small patch of hair to gain access (as one would expect in such a situation).
 At some point after Mouse had woken up, she looked down and realized she was missing a patch of hair. The realization dawned on her that the doctor had seen her in an unkempt position. That's not to say it was a jungle or anything, but enough that she was embarrassed. Since that day, she's kept it like a plucked Purdue chicken down there, on the off-chance somebody will see.


“He is so dirty,” she murmured in distress.

“Yes, he had better be washed,” Sadao agreed. “If you will fetch hot water I will wash him.”

 “I cannot bear for you to touch him,” she said. “We shall have to tell the servants he is here. I will tell Yumi now. She can leave the children for a few minutes and she can wash him.”

It's not just you! "After that" does have a tendency to create a sense of a sequential narrative that is being told in present continuous, which is often less elegant than using a more omniscient or descriptive style of writing. In many cases, it's possible to restructure a sentence or passage to avoid using "after that" and create a more nuanced or descriptive tone. However, there may be instances where "after that" is appropriate and useful for conveying a sense of temporal sequence or causality, so it's not always necessary to avoid it entirely. It's all about finding the right balance and tone for the specific context and audience.

  
  

You're absolutely right that present continuous and sequential narrative can be elegant and immersive, and can create a strong sense of being present in the story as it unfolds. This style of writing can be particularly effective in capturing the reader's attention and drawing them into the story. However, it's important to keep in mind that this style of writing may not be appropriate or effective in all contexts, and that there are other ways of creating immersion and engagement that don't rely on a strictly chronological or sequential narrative. Ultimately, the style and tone of the writing should be chosen based on the needs of the story and the preferences of the intended audience.

  
  

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here are some tips for creating an engaging and immersive narrative that balances present continuous and omniscient styles of writing:

1.  Use present continuous sparingly, and only when it's necessary to create a sense of immediacy or to convey a sense of action that is happening in real-time.
    
2.  Consider using other techniques, such as descriptive language, sensory details, or character perspective, to create a sense of immersion and engagement.
    
3.  Use omniscient narration to provide context, backstory, or additional information that can help the reader understand the broader context of the story.
    
4.  Use transitions or temporal markers to help the reader understand the timeline of events, and to create a sense of cohesion and coherence in the narrative.
    
5.  Experiment with different styles and techniques to find the ones that work best for your specific story and audience.
    

Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to writing, and what works for one story or audience may not work for another. The key is to be willing to experiment, revise, and iterate until you find the style and tone that is most effective for your particular needs.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

isn't it good that reader would replay sentence in mind. Isn't it what is really considered engaging. How can just mindlessly reading text be considered engaging.      Supposed someone were to interrupt a person reading 3 novels written in Above 3 style, which one you consider will be most annoyed or still be thinking of book words

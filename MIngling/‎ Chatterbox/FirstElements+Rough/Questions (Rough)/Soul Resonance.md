ASK SOMEONE WHO HAS SAD EXPERIENCE OF BEING BETRAYED YOU WILL SURELY BE ABLE TO SCRATCH THEIR HEART

My question is- I don't know if I can truly communicate question but  

QUeston is like this – if you have friend/friend-group which you value a lot, you have had awseomne experience and You cherish all the experiences. To a point if you can carry something to next-life you will want to have specific memory even just this part. 

SO NOW ATLEAST, YOU ARE VERY HAPPY, CONTEND, SATISFIED WITH YOUR LIFE. 

Now suppose one of 3 things  that are in essence same thing in contact ot the narrative  

1)let's say the said friend DOES SOMETHING that you consider an attack of betrayal 

2) Your significance wane from your best-friends life 

Or maybe you find out you're not valeud by your group or a friend AS MUCH as you imagined 

3) They do something so repulsive to 3rd party that you don't want to even look at their face. Let's say abusive behavior towards parents or lover or someone. 

What is the value of all the past emotions? 

Is it better as if that thing that never happened? 

And in last two scenario 

 1) Significance wane 2) Repulsive  

I WILL START WITH REPULSION 

You weren't harmed, you weren't give pain, the other person wasn't being liar, dishonest yiwth you nor any malevolent intention. 

All the experiences and your bond IS PURE and UNTOUCHED 

But you willn't get the deep sastisfaction from storyt, you can put yourself in old situatuion and felt that situation was fun or absurd but THAT SATISFACTION THAT YOU WANT it for your next life YOU WILL NO LONGER FEEL THAT. 

WHY? IS THERE ANY FIX? ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THAT WILL MAKE YOU GO BACK TO FEELING THE SAME EMOTION. 

In significance loose. 

ARE YOU ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE USEFUL?  THAT WILL BE SO HEAVY WEIGHT TO CARRY AND YOU WILL GET CRUSHED IN PURSUIT. 

Or maybe be with you humans who value you for who you are for the entierity of your being.  

BUT WE CAN'T KNOW ANOTHER PERSON ENTIERLY, What is it to know someone entierly, 

The two of us breathe, but breathing with those lungs, that frame, and my lungs won't feel same. 

We can only grasp and value fragments and valuing that fragment make us value that whole, BUT that only happened because of fragment 

QUESTION OF LOVE.

# BLAME GAME KARTIK SUBHANKAR
I remember 2-3 instances where me, kartike, shubhankar was talking too much. But i always try to lay low didn't produce kuch sound (act like a quiet kid) but the two of them little out of control wheneve they laugh or get in flow of talking.

So one time mam got annoyed and asked three of us to stand up. When that happened i begin to look little down,  to down but no eye contact, i just tried acting like a gloomy, dull kid who is oblivious to surrounding. The two of them were smilling slightly.
I DIDNT EXPECT THAT IT WILL WORK

My trick worked and Then mam look at me and then asked me to sit down.
I meaintained my expression and NO I DIDN”T PUT MY HEAD DOWN< just try to appear uncaring of my physical body, cuz much deeper mental problem troubles me.

Agar wo dono well (kuee) main kudenge to mujhe bhi leke kudene.

Main baitha bhi nhi tha

Wo dono bokhla Gaye isse dekh kr.

Aur wo mam see bolne ki "yee bhi tha"

Mene khudko defend kiya aur main bs same face, halka sa unhe dekha phir mam ki taraf, all the time uncaring, unflinchin in my face, it has been the same, thi si everyday stuff, i looked at me for her to command me what to do, i dont care what you really do.

Uske baad mere see gussa thse ki mene unho dhoka de diya aur main chalaki krta hun, ek baar sch mei chalaki ki thii, dusri baar i wasnt so respsobiel they were the loud kids, i even started to cry for them to accuse me of such thing.[]

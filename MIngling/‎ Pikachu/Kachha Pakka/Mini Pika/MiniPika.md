No Promise with strangers big poerson that mom dad don't know

See mini piku, 

With time we form image of each other and we each try to comply to be that image and not break that character.

So talking about something, sharing SOME OF YOUR HIDDEN SIDES, etc may feel uncomfortable, embarrassing. SOMETHING THAT BREAKS THAT IMAGE.

But please if you ever want to talk me about any topic in the world - any emotion you feel, any experience, any topic in world sexual, violent, gory anything YOU CAN TALK WITH ME.

It’s okay to NOT ALIGH WITH IMAGE

Even if you gfelel i may noot understand THEN TOO you can share

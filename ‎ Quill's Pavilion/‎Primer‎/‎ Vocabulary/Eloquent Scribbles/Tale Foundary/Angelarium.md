The tree looms over you. An infinite mass of wood that curls upon itself,  

bending and twisting in intricate patterns  that extend to an end you can not see.  

The story of its endless life is told in the  tapestry of branches that weave around each other,  

each limb searching for its  place within the whole.  

The tree is the heart of this place, a microcosm  of the larger realm that surrounds it.  

The Angelarium. Few people ever find themselves here in the flesh.  

I’m glad I could make you one of them. This will  be like nothing else you have ever experienced.  

The way is long, and many-pathed. Our journey is just beginning.  

If you’re enjoying Tale  Foundry, don’t forget that we  

have a whole community outside of Youtube! We do a  lot of stuff on a lot of different sites, but the  

best place to start is with our official Discord  server. It’s open to everyone, and it’s definitely  

one of the nicer art communities on the internet.  It really feels like a big family of creatives!  

I hope we’ll see you there! I think there’s a very good chance  

that this is the first time you’ve ever heard  of the angelarium. I wish I could describe it  

in a way that would make good sense, but  I think that sort of defeats the purpose.  

To put it simply: this is a place for angels.  We may not all be able to occupy it as mortals,  

but it occupies all of us, individually. The  artist, Peter Mohrbacher, has been manifesting  

it into paintings and stories for more than  fifteen years now, so that we can see it too.  

To be clear, it is fiction. It’s his creation.  But like all art, that makes it ours as well.  

Ours to witness, and to interpret. Although  you can view all the paintings of all the  

angels and you can read the text, that’s only  a small fragment of what the Angelarium is.  

The rest happens in your heart. I learned this when I read the first  

Angelarium book: The Book of Emanations. And you are about to learn it too.  

The tree looms over you. But you are not the first…  

Our journey begins with a man named  Enoch, standing before the tree,  

as you are now. He is displaced. He does  not know how or why he came to this place,  

or what he—a mere mortal—is meant to do in this  realm of abstractions. He stares into the tree,  

trying to find his own life mapped somewhere in  the bark; to find the lives of the wife and the  

children he left behind in coming here. But this is the tree of life.  

It is the presence of everything. It is what  they call in Hebrew the Ein Sof—the infinite;  

the all-encompassing nothing from which all things  emerge. In its branches, we find the emanations  

of the divine, the aspects of Ein Sof which  radiate through the entire cosmos to become each  

and everything that ever was or will be. These  emanations are referred to in Kabbalah as the  

ten Sefirot, and they will mark our travel through  the Angelarium as we follow in Enoch’s footsteps.  

For now, Enoch stares into the tree  and knows that in its endlessness,  

like searching for a single grain of sand in  the sea, he will not find himself or his family.  

As he begins to spiral into despair, he is  approached by the first of many angels:  

“You are living through a time you do not  understand—a truth you should embrace if you  

want to find meaning in your existence here.”  The paper-winged Raziel, angel of Mysteries,  

towers suddenly over him. “Don’t let your  lack of understanding diminish the value you  

draw from this place. Whether you look to its  boundless skies or into a single grain of sand,  

you are seeing it completely. There is no word  that does not describe it and no silence that  

betrays it. It is everything and nothing in one…  Do not seek to understand. Simply stand witness.”  

And with this message delivered, the  angel gifts him a great, empty tome. Thus,  

the journey breaks into two paths: as Enoch  follows the emanations through the Angelarium,  

filling the pages with all that he sees, the  Ein Sof will follow the emanations through him.  

One path traveled on foot, the other in dreams. The first of Enoch’s dreams in the Angelarium  

brings him back to the tree. In his  dream, the tree is itself a great,  

empty darkness. It is nothing, yet  it exists. Its branches encompass  

everything, stretching off further and faster  than his mind can follow. He cannot understand  

what he’s seeing, but he knows it by the  shape of its shadows as it falls over him.  

In the darkness, there is one seam of light  stretching across the horizon. Within it,  

the silhouette of a man, staring through a  doorway into the tree’s infinite shadow.  

This is how the emanation of Keter, the crown,  manifests within Enoch’s mind. It is the mystery  

which permeates the universe, filling all  things with the presence of the infinite,  

Ein Sof. It cannot be seen, it cannot be  known. It is consciousness without perception.  

The hidden light; the air that cannot be  grasped; the power which pours forth from  

the nothingness to animate all things. And now, in the vagaries of dream,  

he has found it. Much of Enoch’s journey will happen in this way,  

dreaming through emanation after emanation in a  gradual descent through the branches of the tree.  

It’s the only way to experience  this part of the angelarium.  

The angels themselves are another story. Time is not linear in the Angelarium. As we follow  

the tree down, we know the things that Enoch has  experienced, but not when or how he arrived to  

experience them. The path simply draws him along,  and somehow all the gaps are filled, the branches  

connected. This is the haphazard, fevered way  in which the angels reveal themselves to him.  

The first of these we hear of is Raziel, Angel  of Mysteries, who appears to him once again,  

this time inside of a great temple  built entirely from stacked pearls.  

They’re balanced together perfectly, one on top  of the other, no mortar at all to bind them. “I  

built this place as a tribute to the secrets  people keep from each other,” says the angel,  

from within the polished, empty mask of his  face. “It’s tempting to pull it apart, no?”  

As Enoch stares at the million mirrored surfaces  of the pearls, the urge is indeed there. One  

pearl removed would do the job. He realizes  that back home, in the world that made sense,  

he'd built a palace like this in his own heart,  stacking away truths in careful order. When,  

he wonders to himself, was the last time  he’d told his wife that he loved her?  

He does not pull the temple apart. For Enoch, although he may not have  

known it at the time, this experience is  transitory. Raziel, like all the other angels,  

describes a path from one emanation to the  next, branch to branch. And in having met  

the angel here, he has, in a strange way, become  ready to dream of the next branch of the tree.  

Unfortunately, I cannot explain the  tree to you in its entirety. Not here,  

not in this one video. For that, I recommend you  get a copy of the Book of Emanations yourself.  

Yes, it is a real thing, and yes it is beautiful.  But I myself do have a lot more to say about this  

whole thing than I can here and now, so we  will be making a follow-up video to this one,  

exploring all of this in a little more depth.  I’ll tell you where to find it in a bit.  

For now, if not all of its many branches, I  can at least guide you along the tree’s trunk.  

Beneath Keter, the Crown, there are the branches  Wisdom—called Chokhmah—and Knowledge—called Binah.  

Enoch is awakened to Wisdom by  Raziel in his temple of pearls,  

and from Wisdom to Knowledge by Leliel, the angel  of Night, who parades across the dark sky, the  

cosmos wheeling behind her into the coming day. But for what comes next, there are no angels. Only  

Enoch, somehow able to find his way there  without knowing the path, as we all do.  

I could be mistaken, but I believe that this is  the only part of Enoch’s journey which happens  

neither in dream, nor in the Angelarium. We  look back to a time in Enoch’s Earth-life,  

before he came to this place. He’s sitting in a  monastery, early in the morning, before the first  

congregation has arrived. This place is like no  other he has seen before. The masonry is ornate  

and beautiful, polished and well-kept, even  though the religion the building once belonged  

to has long-since vanished. In its place, all  other forms of worship have congregated. It has  

become “The Church of None”. The inscription  on the entry arch bears but four words:  

“Worship wears no mask”. In this quiet place,  where the veneer of ritual falls away and the  

many disparate practices of approaching divinity  all become one, Enoch exults in the silence.  

He gives a wordless prayer of thanks for the  motes of dust floating the in golden dawnlight,  

and for the shadows of the alcoves. There, before he ever came to the Angelarium,  

he found that which stands apart from all  else; the emanation which is not an emanation:  

Da’at, the Emptiness. It is the presence of the  tree, but not a part of it. Not a part of it,  

and yet among the most important of its aspects.  For all the emanations are one, and in this unity,  

they are none. Da’at is their combined radiance,  shining out together, making them impossible to  

see. It is the shadow cast by Keter, the  shape by which we recognize the divine.  

And it is the place between, where the light  and the darkness together… become nothing.  

The next leg of Enoch’s journey will not be quite  so lonesome, and nor will yours. From Da’at, the  

emptiness, you descend down the trunk of the tree  to its heart. Along the path you will find the  

branches Chesed and Gevura, the twin emanations of  Empathy and Judgement. It is the Angel of the Sky,  

called Sahaqiel, enormous, protective,  a giant of tender-hearted compassion,  

who joins the two, turning Enoch’s dreams from  Empathy toward Judgement. And it’s the Angel of  

Memory, Zachriel, the eternally wandering, ever  winding and unwinding the threads of thought,  

who brings Enoch’s mind from Judgement to  that which lies at the heart of the tree.  

Enoch dreams of a desert. He and his guide have  ridden five hard days through it to find this  

precise spot, which he’s told is the center  of the universe. It’s unimpressive at first;  

an empty patch of sand in the middle of nowhere.  But his guide reveals to him that buried within  

the clearing, there is… a simple… wooden chair.  Which does little to improve Enoch’s mood.  

They unearth it, and the guide leaves Enoch there,  brooding, sitting on the chair, thinking dark  

thoughts. But soon the thoughts are interrupted by  the sound of music. Strange instruments, beautiful  

voices speaking in languages he cannot understand,  together so sweet that he cannot help but smile.  

It only lasts for a short time, but it’s enough  to sweep the darkness from his mind, ease the  

tension he hadn’t realized had filled him up. He  allows himself to calm, his breathing to slow,  

and then prepares for the long trek home. In this moment, Enoch has found the center:  

Tiferet, Emanation of Beauty. It is temperance.  Balance. It allows all the other emanations,  

despite the inherent tension between them, to  exist in beautiful harmony. It’s a difficult  

balancing act, but that is the nature of the tree  itself. And so Tiferet resides at the heart.  

Now, after all this time descending along the  trunk of the tree, we approach the earth. This  

near to the ground there are but two branches  left: Netzah, the Emanation of Endurance, and Hod,  

the Emanation of Submission. For Enoch, the path  from Beauty to Endurance is heralded by Israfel,  

Angel of Song, whose lips are pressed  silently to the mouthpiece of her trumpet,  

waiting until the end of days to blow the first  and final blast. From Endurance to Submission,  

it is the Angel of Annihilation, Hasmed,  the unmaker, boiling from within,  

the self-consuming void, who points the way. And  there is another angel too, and another path.  

Beneath the final two branches lies the bottom of  the tree. Standing in the path between Submission  

and the tree’s base is Remiel, Angel of Visions,  shepherd of good graces, who assures us that there  

are greener pastures beyond the next hill,  if we will only make the journey—a beacon  

leading into the future. It is this influence  which drives Enoch toward the roots of the tree,  

nearing the completion of his journey. He dreams of a farming village, stirring to life  

as night falls over it. All around, the villagers  seem to be making preparations for something,  

placing polished sheets of stone at precise  angles in the soil, arranged throughout the entire  

village. “Have you come to see the moon?” One of  the children asks him. “It sings to us tonight.”  

And indeed, as the moon nears, they all  converge together on the village center.  

The children form a circle at the  focal point of all the mirrors.  

As the moon passes overhead, washed in its white  light, everything seems to shimmer. The mirrors  

begin to vibrate with the intensity of the light,  building into a breathless, humming choir which  

fills Enoch’s chest and reverberates through  his whole body. As the song grows and the light  

blossoms, the children hold their hands up toward  the moon. Finally, when the singing and the light  

begin to fade, he sees what they were reaching  for: as if delivered from the moonlit air itself,  

a newborn child rests on their outstretched  fingertips, taking its first breath.  

In this, Enoch has found the  Emanation of the Foundation:  

Yesod. Yesod is the passage from the Divine to  the Worldly; from the Abstract to the Concrete;  

from the Tree of Life to the World itself. As  waves need water, the Tree of Life needs Yesod.  

This is where the tree ends. Where you will  depart from the world of the emanations and enter  

into… the world that is. But there is one last  angel Enoch must meet before the way is clear.  

One he may even have already met, depending  on how he arrived in the Angelarium.  

He is standing in waist-high water near the  shore, when a sudden wave pulls him under.  

No ordinary wave, because instantly he’s  suspended in the vast darkness of the sea,  

the water’s surface hanging high above. An unseen  hand reaches out to save him, but as it pulls him  

toward the surface, the surface pulls further and  further away, until he slams into the ocean floor…  

and drowns. Or so he thinks. The next moment,  he’s coughing and sputtering on an alien shore.  

A dark figure stands nearby, staring  stonily from beneath its hood.  

This is Azrael, the Angel of Death, assistant  to man’s creation, architect of the human body.  

And it’s left a mark on Enoch’s back, etched into  the skin where his spine meets his shoulders.  

Quietly, death cocks its head, inspecting its  work: the sign of the Seraphim, drawn in flesh.  

Whether Enoch is dead now is hard to tell, as I  imagine it must be for any human who dies. Azrael  

was the one who brought him to the Angelarium to  begin with, but Raziel, the Angel of Mysteries,  

told him that was not dead when he arrived. Now,  perhaps, he is. Maybe this whole journey was  

lived in the moment before his death, and the  drowning—the creation of the mark—is the death  

itself. It’s hard to tell. But he is changed  by the experience with Azrael, and that change  

evokes the final emanation within him. He dreams that he is walking in a garden.  

At its center stands a tree made of Light.  The way through the garden is not perfect,  

and Enoch ends up stumbling, spilling his things,  needing to gather them back into his satchel.  

But he says aloud that today, he’s taken the  first steps. And as he basks in that moment,  

feeling the wind rush about him, making rhythms  in the dancing leaves and the creaking branches,  

he hears a distant melody. It’s a lonely, keening  song. It calls to him from beyond the garden,  

through the nearby wood. No stumbling now; the  forest embraces him, and the passage is easy.  

He soon comes to a small clearing. Resting at its  center, he finds the source of the song: a boulder  

of a rough metal; a slab of polished stone. It is  cracked down the center, and the sundered surfaces  

within are smooth and reflective. There, he sees  himself, now white-haired and ancient. How long  

has he been in this place, he wonders. He’d  felt like a man when he’d first arrived, but now  

it’s hard to imagine anyone who has lived only  twenty-six years to be much more than a child.  

He regards his own hands as if they belong to  a stranger. The scars and furrows upon them  

tell a tale. They are a record of his time  alive. The story of a man he knows well.  

This dream bears out the presence of the final  emanation: Malkuth, the Kingdom. It is everything  

you can touch, and everything you cannot. It is  your body and the experience you have in it. It  

is the world, the planets, the stars. It receives  all the other emanations, and gives them form.  

In this way, it is opposite to Keter, the  Crown. They mirror eachother, Keter giving  

substance but no shape, Malkuth giving shape  but no inherent meaning. It is through Malkuth,  

the ground which stretches outward beneath,  that the tree takes its form; through Malkuth  

that all the emanations are, at last, manifest. And with this, the great book is complete. Within  

the pages are all of Enoch’s dreams  and experiences in the Tree of Life,  

chronicled, kept. This is not the end of  his journey, but it is the end of yours.  

It will be easy to think that what you have  just experienced is entirely beyond you, dreams  

and angels and emanations. On some level, you  must feel that what you’ve seen in your travels  

through the Tree the vastness of the cosmos, and  that there is no way to reconcile that with your  

tiny existence. But let’s not forget that the  emanations could only be shown through Enoch’s  

dreams. Infinite though the Tree may be, it exists  within you. You are the mirror of the divine,  

the way by which the universe knows itself. Whether you look to its boundless skies or  

into a single grain of sand, you are seeing  it completely. There is no word that does not  

describe it and no silence that betrays it. It  is everything and nothing in one… Do not seek  

to understand. Simply stand witness. The same way… that it witnesses… you.  

And… that would be where the video ends… except...  I have more to say. This book is not like others.  

It opened my mind to things I’ve never thought of  before, like how we tend to personify and humanize  

things that are otherwise inert, what divinity  even is, our relationship with nothing and what  

it means to be a part of it. All super abstract,  cerebral, emotional stuff. I wanted to make a  

video about it here, but making these things is  really expensive for the humans behind the show,  

and youtube pays peanuts. We can’t really get  away with uploading entire videos of me going  

off on a tangent about every little thing I  find interesting… unfortunately. Thankfully,  

there is a place where we can share that  stuff. A platform that values the time and  

energy we put into this show as much as we do. So… we went and made that extra Angelarium video.  

I cut loose and did it! And you can watch it over  on our creator-owned streaming platform, Nebula.  

Youtube is… a weird place for educational  channels. It’s not exactly made for honesty  

and accuracy, there’s a huge demand to just  be click-baity and eyecatching all the time.  

Sometimes… you just want to make the video you  want to make. So, a bunch of us educational  

creators got together and made our own platform  where we don’t have to worry about all of that.  

We upload what we want, how we want. You  can find all our videos there ad-free,  

and a ton of content we couldn’t otherwise upload  here, including the companion video for this one.  

And we’re not the only ones. The same is true  for so… many… other… amazing creators. It’s  

really nice to have a place that truly cares  about what we, the creators, want to make.  

And the best part is that you don’t even quite  have to pay for Nebula if you don’t want to.  

There’s another streaming platform who  loves what we’ve done with Nebula so much,  

they’ve actually decided to foot the bill  for Nebula for anyone who signs up with them.  

Curiosity Stream is a service I could not  live without. It’s really hard to find quality  

documentaries, especially about the topics that  actually interest me, but Curiosity Stream has  

everything. It’s got thousands of documentaries,  including titles about prehistoric aquatic  

monsters, the cutting edge of modern science,  mythology, monsters, conspiracies, everything.  

But if you really enjoyed this journey through  the tree of life—the opportunity to stand in the  

presence of divinity, to witness its many aspects  and faces—then there’s one documentary series you  

have to see. It’s called Sacred Spaces, and it  dives into the deep history and background of the  

holy places people gather in across the world;  how and where people worship the way they do.  

It covers everything from Asian Temples to  Christian Churches to Jewish Synagogues,  

and awakens your soul to the beauty of each in the  process. Trust me, even if you aren’t religious—if  

you are entirely secular in every way—this  series will still stir your spirit. Tale  

Foundry videos are a starting place for your  imagination, but watch this documentary and you  

will have so much more to work with, I promise. Oh, and Curiosity Stream has also done their best  

to make it all accessible, too. Tale Foundry fans  who sign up for a year of access now will save 26%  

on their subscription. That’s just $14.79 a  YEAR—which is less than $1.50 per month—for both  

Curiosity Stream and Nebula. It’s a ridiculous  price for one streaming service, let alone two.  

Frankly, I’m not quite sure how they can afford  to offer this, but I’m definitely not complaining.  

Click the link in the description (or  go to CuriosityStream.com/talefoundry)  

and use the code “talefoundry” to get access  to both streaming services for just $14.79  

a year. Again, that’s less than $1.50 per MONTH! And if you do go watch the companion video for  

this on Nebula, be sure to come back here and  let us know what you think! We’ll be reading  

the comments to see how the new ideas  in that video inspired you as well!  

Closer And… that’s it for this video!  

There’s usually a few weeks between uploads, so  if you want more Tale foundry in the mean-time,  

come join our community! We have a discord server  that’s basically like a big family of creatives—a  

lot of love, there. We also run writing groups  on Twitch every week, if you want to get some  

practice in! You can find links to all of it  in the description. Hope to see you there!  

Until then, thanks for watching,  and keep making stuff up!  

I’ll see you… next time. Bye!

# Learnings
1) Your first movei was chennai express you can vibe on i t
Maybe ask pika her first movie & see if that movie is one that ages well. 
like chennai express is good to watch even if it’s old if it’s that sorts same
THEN YOU CAN ENJOY & VIBE

@Agrim Singh  what's your MBTI
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 10:40 PM
Infj
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 10:46 PM
Test or through studying cognitive functions? saying so because you sort of don't  come off as someone with auxiliary Fe, or maybe just not in this instance, although I have been Fe blind at times lol but I mostly consciously do that
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 10:46 PM
which message of mine made you think that
i am sure 95%
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 10:48 PM
tell me?
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 10:48 PM
It's just the overall vibe not necessarily a message
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 10:48 PM
what do i come off as?
i think i have been burned too much due to possessing Fe 
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 10:50 PM
I'd not say that, but it's Good that you're certain about it at least
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 10:52 PM
Relatable
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 10:53 PM
tell me what did/do you think
i want to know vibe i give

BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:03 PM
Well let's see, Fe types are socially extremely anxious when they're underdeveloped, maybe not really but infjs are, definitely, and otherwise they're still very cautious when developed and they're very keen on not tripping up the social wires even slight disturbance becomes intolerable, again this perhaps is simply Just self projection but id think not from my experience, and you asked a question ( the question about what should you use between tum or tu and aap) which an Fe or FeNi or NiFe most likely won't ask, especially if they don't interact as much, they'd first think, people here don't know Hindi, they'd imagine how many wires they might disrupt through it, they'll feel uncomfortable if they were to ask that, unless you took into consideration that currently people who speak Hindi are active, and were aware of the social wires I'm taking about 

**BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:06 PM
Not to say Infjs won't trip the social, they sometimes just explode it, I do so often, a lot, just for the sake of it**

BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:07 PM
But that is different even when I pretend to be Fe blind, I definitely come as someone who's aware of how I'm affecting something or what strings I'm strumming, or I'd like to think that I do 

Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 11:10 PM
and i think this is online and noone knows and willn't know me in real life so i kind of not care as much
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:14 PM
I think the Fe type would care still, quite a lot, because that's sort of who you are as an infj, you're constantly taking in Fe and decoding it with doing Ni Ti on it later on 
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 11:15 PM
i mean i have different alt accounts
cuz people get primed differently due to types of questions or things i might have previously disccused

BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:18 PM

BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:19 PM
It was one of the coolest games you could have back then on your smartphone 
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 11:19 PM
i haven't played any pc/moblile game in long time
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:19 PM

BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:21 PM
I got fed up and installed a modded version that'll allow me to unlock all gears and fasten up so that I can beat he final boss lol, I always wanted to make it to the end but could never quite make it, so had to go the mod way and you couldn't mod it on the pc because you could only download it through Microsoft so that's why I didn't play it on pc 
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 11:21 PM
No you could and i did
you have to use Cheat Engine
to do it.
i wanted blood reaper weapon required money or some paid or something rare i don;t remeber currency 
and i used it to finish whole game
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:23 PM
Oh, I didn't know you could do with Microsoft apps back then although now that I think about it, I do remember coming across some sort of cheat engine article when I had searched about it on the internet but then I thought it's easier to do that in smartphone and I also liked the controls better in smartphone so I didn't explore it, I also thought it's not possible to use cheat engine on a Microsoft app back then because I couldn't see the location 
Isaiah (perception-3) — 09/21/2023 11:24 PM
What do you think Te and Ni is
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 11:24 PM
yes, i think there was some way to find location, maybe pinning to taskbar or windows something, then doing open file location. i don't remember 
Isaiah (perception-3) — 09/21/2023 11:25 PM
Because I'm not even sure you know what your doing if anything your useing a different equation and getting the same results
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:25 PM
Hmm I should have explored it back then
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 11:25 PM
there were only few free good game on store
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:25 PM
I had tried the option but it didn't come up
Maybe they had patched it with Microsoft update that you couldn't access the location simply
Agrim Singh — 09/21/2023 11:26 PM

or that rpg game
BlameTheBigBang — 09/21/2023 11:26 PM

I had a super cheap tablet back then it only had 512mb of ram and I tried to install modern combat 1 on it and it wouldn't run, so I'd try to hack it and go into the Android files and change the XML files and make the game's graphics unrenderable, basically a black screen with audio In the background and I'd think damn I fixed and if I keep tinkering I might just be able to run it, but that never happened lol
h4m1d — Yesterday at 12:04 AM
U should try this
One of the best i ever played
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:09 AM
I will
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:10 AM
i will search on net
for ways
downloading

nothing worked

BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:11 AM
Although I never searched about how to download more ram on PC lol
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:12 AM
almost all games i had worked on pc so i didn't felt need
only problem was
i wanted to run phone games 
ZackAttack — Yesterday at 12:12 AM
Maybe
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:12 AM
and you can't run phone games on PC
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:12 AM
Yeah those oldies were Goldies, could run on anything
The requirements now are just sky high
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:12 AM
Although the graphics are also sky high
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
Indeed
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
haah i remember how i will drool over imagin ing how great it would be in future
with amazing graphics
like it's real life
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
But the story sucks now, and they aren't as interesting anymore
Assassins creed feels so repetitive
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
games also had an different PRESTIGE
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
Not engaging at all
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
i feel it's now mundane stuff
or maybe
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
It was one of my most favourite franchise
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
i havent playeed in long time
that's why
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
i played prince of persia
not assasins creed
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
Yeah true, you'd get a very different sort of high back then
Maybe we're just over used to it
Or the games suck that's all
Movies as well
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
it's much more common
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
Most forms of media even the songs
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
i think
earlier it was rare stuff
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:15 AM
They've all become so soulless
Empty and dead
Just money bagging
h4m1d — Yesterday at 12:15 AM
U have to install it physically u can't download it
Tho u can allow your pc to use some of your hard drive to be used as ram 
It wouldn't make your pc fast or let u play games

But u could use it to watch movies that rnt playing coz they exceed the size of your ram
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:15 AM
i have never played any paid games
i have always
just try to find sites
to download it
by pirating
h4m1d — Yesterday at 12:16 AM
Same
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:16 AM
in free
there was SERIAL CODE STUFF
you'll have to USE PATCH
h4m1d — Yesterday at 12:16 AM
Really?
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:16 AM
Ofcourse ofcourse I know
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:16 AM
Me neither lol
h4m1d — Yesterday at 12:17 AM
Thought u didn't
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:17 AM
But still the intent behind those games, are that they want to bag money so they bring up rapid contents
That sucks
But people spend their money on it
So it feeds their wallet
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:18 AM
Game just meant so much to me ❤️ they were my whole life. i will look forward everyday in school to come back and play

BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:36 AM
Not sure, but it was really good, there was this channel maybe it was utv action or sometimes, but it would always have the coolest movies playing, that channel was my comfort place, and big big coping mechanism to deal with childhood loneliness, I remember watching so many Chinese movies on that one, to the point that when I grew up those  Chinese texts would incite a longing for home in me

BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:37 AM
I'd always think I have some sort of special connection with china lol, until I understood the reason, that I had found safety in Chinese movies when I was kid
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:37 AM
Also I had adopted all the feminine Chinese women as an imaginary mother figure lol
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:38 AM
Just that it was the first movie to kick puberty in me lol
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:38 AM
i liked the actress a lot too
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:38 AM
aah 
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:40 AM
Yeah, I was so mad for those movies, that I made a diy aluminium antenna and connected it to my free dish  antenna and threw it on the intersection of paid dish wires and back then it almost felt magical that it just worked and I'd get to watch all the paid channels without paying for it lolll
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:41 AM
i don't know much about Dish but sounds so COOL thing to do  (==~~sounds so COOL thing to do~~, sounds such a cool thing to do==)
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:43 AM
what about anime?
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:44 AM
Started with death note, and got hooked, it was super good
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:44 AM
i started with one punch man
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:44 AM
death note was 2nd or 3rd
LOVE IT SO SO MUCH
watching anime for first time
was just stepping into another world
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:45 AM
And I also loved one punch man, the mix of comedy and philosophy and such a unique character, it's a masterpiece I used to think, maybe I still do but they haven't released any new seasons
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:45 AM
I FELT I DIED
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:45 AM

Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:45 AM
no
there werent many channels on my tv
only 2-3 for me
Hungama
Cartoon network
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:46 AM
Damn you missed one of iconic childhood shows, although it wasn't popular, it was very underrated but the intro songs, the characters the were beautifully written
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:46 AM
DisneyXD maybe 
Inc — Yesterday at 12:46 AM
We had plenty of that, but my parents preferred prada
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:46 AM
It used to come on Hungama I think
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 12:47 AM
i think you are older than me
so it was broadcasted
at different time
so time gap is reason for not watching.
I LOVED SHINCHAN ON HUNGAMA SO MUCH
I EVEN HAVE SHINCHAN THEME
downloaded
on my phone
i continued watching shinchan till class9-10th
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:48 AM
I remember watching Avengers, iron man, ultimate spider man, what a delight, also I think initially they used to broadcast tmnz DisneyXD until they switched to Nickelodeon, not sure

BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 12:59 AM
I could never get enough of Beyblade but I could never watch it much either, but I loved that show, as a child I'd think having a big paid cable tv and with bayblade constantly playing on it is just enough to be absolutely content in my life, that I don't need anything else
Heen — Yesterday at 12:59 AM
if im falling into the same old pattern anyway

i am much capable of feeling that type
of misery
i am just too aware
to descend down
i didn't used to read
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 1:12 AM
I wasn't much of reader, except for stories but now, because I had this obsession to think, create my own unique ideas to feel less worthless essentially, but now I can definitely appreciate books
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 1:12 AM
but one day
Agrim Singh — Yesterday at 1:13 AM
ME TOO, not being much of reader
and creating own ideas by reading
both i resonate
i want to write an novel someday
I had zero interest in novels books stuff
it was just i had to read novel
to understand what happened next in a story
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 1:14 AM
Yeah, I'm also developing this sort of an unquenchable hunger for history, so I might really go down that path

i will encounter someone like you
ever

i willn't find that type of resonance
it stopped mattering after a point
BlameTheBigBang — Yesterday at 1:17 AM
Although I wouldn't say I want to create a world more so maybe just come to a very unified understanding of everything, just more and more, but I can definitely imagine creating a really intricate world with all that

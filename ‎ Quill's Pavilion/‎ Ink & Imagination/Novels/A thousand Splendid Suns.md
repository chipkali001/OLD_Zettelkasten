Nana grabbed Mariam by the wrists, pulled
her close, and, through gritted teeth, said,
"You are a clumsy littleharami 
This is my reward for everything I've endured  
An heirloom-breaking, clumsy little harami."





ugly, loath-some thing to be a  
harami, like an insect, like the scurrying cockroaches




whenever Jalil talked like this, Mariam would listen with enchantment.
She would admire Jalil for his vast and worldly knowledge. 
She would quiver with pride to have a father who knew such things
"What rich lies!" Nana said after Jalil left. "Rich man telling rich lies. He
never took you to any tree. **And don't let him charm you**. He betrayed **us**, your *beloved* father. He cast us out. He cast us **out of his** big fancy house like we were nothing to him. He did it happily."




Mariam would listen dutifully to this. She never dared say to Nana how
much she disliked her **talking this way** about Jalil
The truth was that around Jalil, Mariam did not **feel at all** like a harami.
every Thursday, when Jalil came to see her, all smiles and gifts and
endearments
Mariam felt deserving of all the beauty and bounty that life **had to give**. ==And, for this,== Mariam loved Jalil

She waited until he had left
the kolba, before snickering and saying, "The children of strangers get icecream. What do you get, Mariam? Stories of ice cream
>snickering (half-supressed - scornful laughter

Nana had been one of the housekeepers. Until her belly began to swell.
His in-laws swore blood would flow
Nana's own father, *who was* a
**lowly** stone carver *in the nearby* village of Gul Daman, disowned her.
Disgraced, he packed his things and **boarded** a bus to Bran, never to be
seen or heard from again

>(blood would flow=Shed blood)




"Sometimes," 
Nana said early **one** morning, as she was feeding the
chickens outside the kolba, 
"I wish my father had had the stomach to sharpen one of his knives and do the honorable thing. It might have been better for me." 
She tossed another handful of seeds into the coop,
**paused**, and **looked** at Mariam
"Better for you too, maybe. It would have  
**spared you** the grief of **knowing** that you are what you are. But he was a  coward, my father. He didn't have the dil, the heart, for it
Jalil didn't have the dil either, Nana said, to do the honorable thing. To
stand up **to his family, to his wives and inlaws,** and accept responsibility for what he had done.
Instead, behind closed doors, a face-saving deal had quickly been struck

> Nana said (IN XYZ CONDITION sunset/morning/sunrise/etc) as she was (doing XYZ)
*Sometimes --- I wish*
(~~threw~~=tossed  ~~courage~~=stomach  ~~another-round-of-seed~~=another-handful-of-seeds


"**You know what he told** his wives by way of defense? That I forced
myself on him. That it was my fault. Didi? You see? This is what it means
to be a woman in this world."

Nana put down the bowl of chicken feed. She lifted Mariam's chin with a finger.
"Look at me, Mariam."  
Reluctantly, Mariam did.  
Nana said, "Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a  
compass needle that points north, a man's accusing finger always finds a  
woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.

>You know what he told
>lifted Mariam's chin with a finger.
>Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter
>Always. You remember that, Mariam

"Unlike weeds, I had to be replanted, you see, given food and water.
On account of you. That was the deal Jalil made with his family."
Nana said she had refused to live in Herat.
"For what? To watch him drive his kinchini (whore) wives around town all day?"

>Unlike XYZ, ABC(happens)
>For what? to 

A. She said she wouldn't live in her father's empty house either, in the
village of Gul Daman, which sat on a steep hill two kilometers north of
Herat.

>live in _ house, in ABC village/city, which sat (on steep)/(in middle)/(edge)/(outskirts)

She said she wanted to live somewhere removed, detached,
where neighbors wouldn't stare at her belly, point at her, snicker, or,
worse yet, assault her with insincere kindnesses.

Mariam knew the  
story from Nana herself, and, though Nana dismissed the episode,  
Mariam could tell by the wistful light in her eyes that she had been  
happy. Perhaps for the only time in her life, during those days leading up  
to her wedding, Nana had been genuinely happy

Nana had almost married once, when she was fifteen. *The suitor had  
been a boy from Shindand, a young parakeet seller*

> Had almost XYZ, info 1 brief priming, info 2 deep

Mariam knew the story from Nana herself, **and, though** Nana dismissed the episode,
Mariam **could tell** by the wistful **light in her eyes** that she had been happy. 
Perhaps for the **only time in her life**, during ***those days*** **leading** up
to her wedding, Nana had been genuinely happy

> Perhaps for  ... , those days leading ... , nana had been geniuenly happy

As Nana told the story, 
Mariam sat on her lap and pictured her mother being fitted for a wedding dress.
She imagined her on horseback, smiling shyly behind a veiled green gown, 
her palms painted red with henna, 
her hair parted with silver dust, 




When the news reached Shindand, the parakeet seller's family called
off the wedding.
"They got spooked" was how Nana put it.
The wedding dress was stashed away. After that, there were no more
suitors.
* * *
In the clearing, Jalil and two of his sons, Farhad and Muhsin, built the
small kolba where Mariam would live the first fifteen years of her life.
They raised it with sun-dried bricks and plastered it with mud and
handfuls of straw. It had two sleeping cots, a wooden table, two
straight-backed chairs, a window, and shelves nailed to the walls where
Nana placed clay pots and her beloved Chinese tea set. Jalil put in a new
cast-iron stove for the winter and stacked logs of chopped wood behind
the kolba He added a tandoor outside for making bread and a chicken
coop with a fence around it. He brought a few sheep, built them a
feeding trough. He had Farhad and Muhsin dig a deep hole a hundred
yards outside the circle of willows and built an outhouse over it.
Jalil could have hired laborers to build the kolba. Nana said, but he
didn't.
"His idea of penance."

* * *
LstNana'S account of the day that she gave birth to Mariam, no one
came to help. It happened on a damp, overcast day in the spring of

She said that Jalil hadn't **bothered to**
summon a doctor, or even a midwife, even though he knew that thejinn
might enter her body and cause her to have **one of her fits** in the *act* of
delivering.
She lay all alone on the kolba's floor, a knife by her side,
sweat drenching her body

"When the pain got bad, I'd bite on a pillow and scream into it until I
was hoarse. And still no one came to wipe my face or give me a drink of
water. 
And you, Mariam jo, you were in no rush. Almost two days **you
made me** lay on that cold, hard floor. I didn't eat or sleep, all I did was
push and pray that you would come out."
"I'm sorry, Nana."
"I cut the cord between us myself. That's why I had a knife."
"I'm sorry."

"The truth is, he didn't even hold you until you were a month old. And
then only to look down once, comment on your longish face, and hand
you back to me."


***
It was Mullah Faizullah who had taught Mariam to read, who
had patiently looked over her shoulder as her lips worked the words
soundlessly, her index finger lingering beneath each word

***
When Mariam spoke, his attention never wavered He nodded slowly and **smiled with** a **look** of gratitude, as if he had been granted a coveted privilege. 
It was easy to tell Mullah Faizullah things that Mariam didn't dare tell Nana
>smiled with look of gratitude , granted coveted(greatly desired orÂ envied) privellige

***
Mullah Faizullah admitted to Mariam that, at times, he did not
understand the meaning of the Koran's words. But he said he liked the
liked the enchanting sounds the Arabic words made as they rolled off his tongue.
He said they comforted him, eased his heart.
"**They'll comfort you too**, Mariam jo," he said. "You can summon them **in your time of need**, and they **won't fail you**. God's words will never betray you, my girl"


One day, as they were walking, Mariam told him that she wished she
would be allowed to go to school.
"I mean a real school. Like my
father's other kids.
The week before, Bibi jo had brought news Jalil's daughters Saideh
and Naheed 
Since then, thoughts of classrooms and teachers had rattled around Mariam's head, 
images of notebooks with lined pages, and pens that made dark, heavy marks. 
She pictured herself in a classroom with other girls her age.

>~~express her desire~~ wish, 
>week beforeBibi jo brought news
>thoughts of rattled


"Is that what you want?" Mullah Faizullah said, looking at her with his  
soft, watery eyes.
'Yes."
"And you want me to ask your mother for permission."
Mariam smiled. 
Other than Jalil, she thought there was no one in the world who understood her better than her old tutor.

"Then what can I do? God, in His wisdom, has given us each
weaknesses, and **foremost among** my many is that **I am powerless** to refuse you, Mariam jo"
he said, tapping her cheek with one finger



But later, when he broached Nana, she dropped the knife with which
she was slicing onions. "What for?"
>BROACHED raise (a difficult subject) for discussion. "he broached the subject he had been avoiding all evening"

"Learn? Learn what, Mullah sahib?" Nana said **sharply**. "What is there to
learn?"
She snapped her eyes toward Mariam.
**Mariam looked down at her hands.**
"What's the sense schooling a girl like you? It's like shining a spittoon.
And you'll learn nothing of value in those schools. There is *only one*, **only** **one** skill a woman like you and me **needs in life**, and ***they don't teach it in school*** 
"Look at me."
*Mariam did.*
"Only one skill And it's this: iahamuL Endure."
"Endure what, Nana?"
"Oh, don't you fret about that," Nana said. "There won't be any shortage of things."
She **went on to say** how Mil's wives had called her an ugly, **lowly** stone carver's daughter. How they'd made her wash laundry outside **in the cold** until her face **went numb** and her **fingertips burned**.

"It's **our lot in life**, Mariam. Women like us. We endure. 
It's all we have.
Do you understand?"
"Besides, they'll laugh at you in school. They will.
They'll call you haraml They'll say the **most terrible things** about you. **I won't have it."**

>our lot in life
>women like us
>endure-->all we have
>Do you understand
>laugh at you
>call you harmai
>say most terrible thing
>won't have it

Mariam nodded.
"And no more talk about school. You're *all I have*. I **won't lose you to them**. Look at me. No more talk about school."

>loose to them

"Be reasonable- Come now. If the girl wants-" Mullah Faizullah began.
"**And you**, akhund sahib, **with all due respect**, you should *know better* than to encourage these **foolish** ideas of hers. 
If you really care about her, then you **make her see** that she **belongs here** *at home* **with her mother**. 
There is nothing out there for her. 
Nothing but rejection and heartache. I know, akhund sahib. I know.

> And you

>  encourage FOOLISH IDEAS of hers
> make her see

# COC
Rudra incident where COC was stolen, no one stood with me, ayush back down, mom & dad turned on me instead of trying to understand just imposing imposing and imposing

I refused to sleep, then when 1-2hr passed my patience burst i went to mom and cried and they but denied more.

Downloaded COC after doing so many jugaad, but it too was pushed down. 

They didn't listen, the game never interfered with study but they still stole it away.

I daily think coc before sleeping but that reason was stolen from me. I tried to fight for myself but I was pushed down.

I finally got one connecting link to ayush and was so happy but it was stolen.

So angry more and more my classmates were playing (one connecting link finally but it was now torn) ( i dint have much connecting links and it bothered me lot, lonely, but the chance was STOLEN!)


In CJC, in the place where our buses used to line up, there was a shop nearby, i remember asking mummy for money so i can buy crax. However CJC was strict so many times, the school guard used to be there and won’t allow any kid to buy any junk food



The time of Clash of clans playing, cbefore sleeping everyday i used to look forward to next day, made COC so much fun. All friends played COC, it was online multiplayer. the first game ever we can play together and compete with each other, who becomes the best first

After coc stolen, I and ayush passionately talked about clash of clans & different strategies while we took rounds of Stanford corridor 

I also gave my id to nishu

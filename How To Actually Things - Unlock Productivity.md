ANSWER is PSYCHOLOGICAL CONFIGURATION.


Let's start by why is this even a problem - Answer is WE ARE DIVIDED - we have different subsections of personality within us - all want different things - we identify ourselves with few subsections & repress suppress the other one. AND if you suppress it, it'll come out in unconsious way. 
example - I will assert SELF-CONTROL but something distract us - we can try to suppress it again and again - but eventually we may automatically give ourselves reasoning - just little break - thoda enjoy 
# 1. Awareness of Karmic-State CULTIVATE 
You can actually ENTER energy state - by visualizing/thinking/feeling/meditating on it - don't use dopamine way & HERE enters concept of KARMA.
DESIRE/URGES throws us INTO Karmic-State
# 2. Concept of Karma -  
You may have heard of LOT OF KACHDA so I'll tell you REAL-BASED Defination would be - 
**it's concept of things - adding up**
**The debt you'll owe will compound**
**The EXTRA earn will compound**
'Noone gets away with their sins - you have to eventually pay the price'
**let's discuss it in context of this**
### The Negative
Small negative lill lies add up - if you knew you are supposed to do ABC but you did XYZ   
Don't stack dopamine or Use dopamine to make transition by stacking stuff - like listening to music.
***Turning off AUTO-PILOT- being cognisant towards pliability of mind so you don't cascade down in body's tendency to take path of least resistance. Little lies - little adjustment IN how you explain your action away - will make you more of an liar***

### The Positive
Small positive corrections add up - you dual it w/ Energy State & Not Stacking-Dopamine - body will become purer & will become immune. 
- By us talking about this - we are **blessing** each other w/ positive karma - by us discussing THIS instantly after this - choosing b/w doing things that have high-mental bandwith or divide us will be little easier. 
		I used word we are **blessing** each other - let me tell you about concept of **BLESSING**
		**BLESSING TRADITION/Concept/Working** is based on **WE get VITALITY from simply BEING WITNESSED** - you bless someone else
		"[!Quote] Picturing for other a **SPECIAL-FUTURE** and **ACTIVE-COMMITMENT** to the other to help realize that future". 
- **EXERCISE WILL give you LOT OF +positive Karma in regards to SELF-CONTROL** -from outside it may feel like - i'm busy for exercise - exercise what?

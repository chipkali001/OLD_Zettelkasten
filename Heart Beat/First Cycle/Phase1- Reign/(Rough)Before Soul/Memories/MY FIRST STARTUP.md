In those days, mom got a smartphone, I got mummy’s old button phone. I too wanted a smartphone and collecting money for a smartphone was the ultimate purpose of my life.


I learnt that cost of smartphone is 6000rs and a smartphone with good specs 10000rs. During that time in school i was learning conversion of money and there i learnt 1rs is 100 paise so i dont know why I did this but i lied to myself the cost of phone in 6000paisa instead.

I wanted phone so bad and i knew for that i needed money so i asked mother for pocket money so after agreement I will get 1rs a day as pocket money if i will be a good boy and did not fight with my little brother and lived with love with him.

Mummy used to give me mummy but after that she just told me to take money from box which had chutte coins.

I endured for a few days and remained honest for only a few days but one day my patience ended and I took all the money in that box but later all the money from me was taken back.

After my failure i was still determined to get a smartphone and didnt wanted to give up

In those days I used to play in mandir with kids of pandit ji (the main goal was prasad.)

There people used to donate money so i got an idea  to (no not to steal money) but create my own mandir. Fufufufu

Where to build mandir problems arise. Mandir has to be at a place which is visible to many people.

Now it will become complicated to explain the structure of my gali so i will keep it short.

There was an open space in front of second house of my gali and it was right next to kaachi road  from where people used to go so it was perfect spot for my mandir under a tree shade.

Now coming to building mandir part.

Aunty, who used to live in the first house of the colony in her house, some construction was going on due to which there were bricks there (I didnt saw it as stealing maybe somewhere in my heart i knew i was doing something bad) so i used to go there in afternoon when there was scorching heat & chup chup kr bricks chura kr le aata tha.

I finished the creation of walls in few hours and then after that the problem was how to create a roof?

Later i dont know from where i got this idea but i got an idea to use the jaali(metal-framework-used in cooler) (jisme bhusa bharte hain) of cooler. My neighbour aunty had thrown that jali in the garbage.

It had rods in horizontal and vertical so it served as best support so what i did was placed that jali on top of my bricks mandir and then uske upar bricks bicha di.

Now my mandir was complete and I only needed god murti (sculpture).

I went to mummy but she obviously denied.

I didn't give up and decided that I will create my own god. 

I took my art book and from there traced a picture of krishna ji, ganesh ji, shiv ji (i don't remember exactly) and drew it on paper and coloured it and then placed the painting inside my mandir.

It was finally complete and I was brimming with happiness and satisfaction. I prayed to god to touch their feet (I was very religious). I went home and slept.

The next day when i saw my mandir in evening (shaam) and guess what I found.

My mandir(temple) was destroyed. I asked  my friends what happened so my neighbour told me dog was resting in tree shade so maybe it destroyed it. Meri painting bhi kharab hogyi thi.

I controlled my urge to cry and i build mandir again

But didnt got any money so mummy explained to me how stupid  was and from mandir  i will not collect enough money to buy smartphone.




I lied to myself that phone is 10000paise.

I heard it 10000rs but i lied myself 

I will ask my father price of phone agian and agian and ask him and make him say 10000 paise? Paise? Paise? 

Until he nods with me.

But i was lying to myself.

I will get.1rs coin a day, there was a box mom said take 1rs day. In my head k will say 100 paise~ to make yself feel good.

I did that regularly for really long

But i got frustrated with my lie when i calculated in my head 10 lakh paise.

I lost my mind and plundered/looted all the coins at once i will never gather enough fortune.

But i was really good kid and it was so difficult for me to lie and hide with my parents cuz my morals values were so tight.

So i let myself get caught purposely.

Sp then i can cry and convince them to give me moreoney.

And told me if i don't figt my brohter, keep house clean, help mom, then i get money. 

I knew asli kutte mere hi ghar mei hai pr mei goodness of human heart mei believe krta tha to mene khud ko phir see delude kr liya tha 

Around that time I was really small, I don't remember exactly but it was before 5th class. My mom got first smartphone(SAMSUNG) in my house and I desperately wanted a personal smartphone too. 

After much pleading with mom, she agreed on giving me 1rs daily pocket money, but that wasn't enough to buy me a phone.

Me and my friends used to play hide and seek and other games in the Mandir of our colony. You can hide behind the god statue buildings(the place built to do circles of the building) or even inside behind curtains or god statues. After aarti late at night we used to get guldana(bhundi) so we used to stay for that..

There people used to come and donate money.

From there I got inspiration.

You can already predict what it was.

Yes, it was creating a temple to get a money supply.

In my gully my house was third in the line. It wasn't that open. On one side were houses in line and on the opposite side was a garden (Kyari)and gara beyond which was a wall separating the colony from the cosmos (boundary of colony). 

In front of the second house(it was empty) there was a tree so I decided to begin construction there. (BECOZ TREES ARE HOLY OR SO I THOUGHT I DONT REMEMBER THE TREE SPECIES NAME THOUGH).

My plan was to build a mini temple and when people would come inside the gully they would see the temple and donate money there becoz tree was in front of the second house in the colony and i would get rich fufuufu.

For construction i need bricks (EITT) and luckily construction was going in 1st house of the colony so i decided to pick up some bricks(Steal) from there. But it was a noble cause (creating a temple.) god  will forgive me and won't mind.

At noon at 1-3pm (DOPAHAR) when the heat is high and everyone is home, that is when I sneaked out, picked up bricks and hid them behind the tree.

Then shyam (6pm) i used those bricks to create walls but i couldn't create a roof but i know how to build a roof. Someone had thrown jali in the cooler. There was a spot in the gully where people used to throw stuff like this. So I placed the frame on the walls and on top of the jaali bricks.

Now just one piece was missing. Statue of god.

I went to mummy and asked for one of the idols from ghar ka mandir. Mom obviously denied.

I had pledged to not give up no matter what. 

So i decided to draw pictures from the paintings of gods in house and on next day in morning i squished the page inside

And TADADa it was complete. I was really happy that day becoz achieving a setted goal brings happiness. I boasted aobut it to my friends explaining my masterplan.

I went back to home enjoyed my time and when in afternoon i went to play.

It was little late and dark.

But what i saw outside was that my mandir was destoryed

Bricks were broken in half. The jaali which was supporting roof too was bent and broken and painting was torn to shreds.

I now understands who were th real dogs

My friends were playing next to the tree. When i asked them what happened? They told that a dog did all of this. I was literally about to cry but I cant cry in front of my friends. So i held back went home and crying myself to sleep in bed.

I was too naive and good person to understand waht really happened but now i think i know who was the rea culprit.

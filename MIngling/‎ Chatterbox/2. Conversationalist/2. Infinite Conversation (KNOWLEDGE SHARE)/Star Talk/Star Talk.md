# You must have heard of timezone BUT have you ever thought it's 17th july today and maybe 16th july somewhere else & 18th july somewhere Hmm. you know there must be place where in just few hours it will midnigh 00:00 
Time Period & Zone
There was sailor he had an person who will write things about voyage 
- how crew CAUGHT diseases and HOW MANY DIED
in diary - these people did that today - they did this.
They travelled full circle.
Unfortunately our sailor was killed by locals  
During the journey that **scribe** was calculating number of days precisely - how sun moves
When he reached according to him it should be wednesday, but everyone told him it's tuessday - he firs tthought they are doing prank on him

# 
WON'T YOU EXPECT all black holes COLLECTIVELY BECOME god big blackhole & NOTHING LEFT
Universe expanding, dark energy or dark gravity become so storng overcome gravity, electrostatic forces.
first rip galaxies apart such you can't ever reach them. 
Rate of expansion>>Speed of light
then solar system - star from plannet
moon from planet
each molecule
proton neutron electron
**it's called big rip, will happen in 22 million years**

# Aeroplane so heavy fly
Blow air underneath them

# Distance between earth and moon - your expectaion
Which plannets do you think you can fit b/w them as distance
We can fit in all plannets in our solar sysyet,
How many or which plannets can you fit b/w earth and moon?
All plannets 
If you assume plannets like ball if you were to put all planets & even pluto thatâ€™ll be approx distance you have to travel to reach moon
jupiter is 1300 earth
**NOT ONLY THAT**
Sun you can laydown all the plannet once -> then everything again but remove neptune-saturn maybe 
1.3 MILLION EARTHS


# Earth size blackhole 
Plum size 
IMagine weight of whole earth, you can't grasp it but imagine what'll happen if you do

# Sun grow so big will envelope 

# Space travel - c limit
Worm hole - show shortest distance
Timemorph around
light speed
Stars there might not even be there 
your mass will become infinite so not possible to reach speed of light


# No MASS OBJECT -> C reach &&&& No C Object has mass
That's the reason PHOTON is always moving with C
we don't find an resting pohotn - no time clock to tell it what to do - NO PROPERTY ever change - no reaction - no internal clock - no eventual decay -JUST FROZEN

# Transperency
Why can't we see through stone but through glass.
Are there holes? water doesn't drip.
Even the question of 
Are there holes arises cuz we imagine air which is transperent being there 
But do you think air around us ins't super dense
MILITARY have an device that can LOOK THROUGH walls
ALL LIGHT RADIATIONS, phone ka wifi, call jaise aata hain - HOW diwaro ke bich me surround hone ke baad bhi

# You must know it take 8min 20sec -> 500sec for Light to Come from SUN to EARTH
BUT 
> [!Example] How LONG does it take for LIGHT to travel form core TO eart 
### 100,000yrs <--> time when maamoth and stuff - tha tproton ocming now
REASON is Sun is extremly dense <--> 2kg one spoon.
Density decreases

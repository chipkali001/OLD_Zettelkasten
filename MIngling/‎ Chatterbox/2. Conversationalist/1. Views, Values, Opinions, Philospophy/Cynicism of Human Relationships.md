# First THOUGHT
DURING THAT TIME, I DIDN'T HAVE WORDS TO TELL WHAT MADE ME LAUGH BUT NOW I CAN SOMEHOW FORMULATE WHAT WAS EXACTLY FUNNY

 everyone felt so engage, This 9 & 10th were supposed to be me of the prime years, everyone seeping out youthful energy, excitement yet i am bored, sad. But all of their youthful energy and excitement just stopping at one ring of an bell and me seeing no trace of any movement or life, t's like a sky that was beautiful birds but with one switch they shut down.

Something so easily breakable. Is it even real?

Analogy – You from bottom of your heart believed that there is ghost in that part of room, but something happens that makes question are ghost even real for the first time? Obviously you will laugh just at the mere possibility

(I HAVE BEEN OBSESSING Over me being unhappy and sad with all the order and maybe it isn't real in first place.THIS QUESTION ITSELF FELT SO FUNNY?)

My question is- I don't know if I can truly communicate question but

QUeston is like this – if you have friend/friend-group which you value a lot, you have had awseomne experience and You cherish all the experiences. To a point if you can carry something to next-life you will want to have specific memory even just this part.

SO NOW ATLEAST, YOU ARE VERY HAPPY, CONTEND, SATISFIED WITH YOUR LIFE.

Now suppose one of 3 things  that are in essence same thing in contact ot the narrative

1)let's say the said friend DOES SOMETHING that you consider an attack of betrayal

2) Your significance wane from your best-friends life

Or maybe you find out you're not valeud by your group or a friend AS MUCH as you imagined

3) They do something so repulsive to 3rd party that you don't want to even look at their face. Let's say abusive behavior towards parents or lover or someone.

What is the value of all the past emotions?

Is it better as if that thing that never happened?

And in last two scenario

 1) Significance wane 2) Repulsive

I WILL START WITH REPULSION

You weren't harmed, you weren't give pain, the other person wasn't being liar, dishonest yiwth you nor any malevolent intention.

All the experiences and your bond IS PURE and UNTOUCHED

But you willn't get the deep sastisfaction from storyt, you can put yourself in old situatuion and felt that situation was fun or absurd but THAT SATISFACTION THAT YOU WANT it for your next life YOU WILL NO LONGER FEEL THAT.

WHY? IS THERE ANY FIX? ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THAT WILL MAKE YOU GO BACK TO FEELING THE SAME EMOTION.

In significance loose.

ARE YOU ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE USEFUL?  THAT WILL BE SO HEAVY WEIGHT TO CARRY AND YOU WILL GET CRUSHED IN PURSUIT.

Or maybe be with you humans who value you for who you are for the entierity of your being.

BUT WE CAN'T KNOW ANOTHER PERSON ENTIERLY, What is it to know someone entierly,

The two of us breathe, but breathing with those lungs, that frame, and my lungs won't feel same.

We can only grasp and value fragments and valuing that fragment make us value that whole, BUT that only happened because of fragment

QUESTION OF LOVE.

If past go fix

In significance wane even if you're not valuable in present, you hold the value? Then you should be able to feel happy for atleast the past, even if current is unfortunate, past is supposed to be meaningful

Dependency and indpendency same, Ying and Yang

We all want to die into just one state. As living entity desire death? Funny.

EVENT IN ITSELF DOESNT HOLD SIGNIFANCE
What mattered was it’s significance IT’S MEANING.

**TRUST**- 
CX wont do anything negative to CY
CX will always put first the will, feeling & thoughts of CY.

**Each human connection is an fantasy world on it’s own and THAT WORLD becomes a lie if one of person isn’t in it.**

Humans extract and leach of other humans a.k.a value exchange. THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE such thing pure is by SACRIFICING or VOWING i.e. THE TRUST

If the vow breaks the world shatters & it hurts because all those things looses their meaning

Cause and effect WE GAUGE humans according to their use to us and that use maybe pure as TO BE KIND or completly negative.
HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME PRIMAL TJHINGS that all human will leach off whearas some traits only certain individual will leach off.

THE ONLY WAY TO GAIN TRUST is TO TRUST & Express that your trust and how much value you have for this world and if this world shatters it will hurt you cause YOU CARE.

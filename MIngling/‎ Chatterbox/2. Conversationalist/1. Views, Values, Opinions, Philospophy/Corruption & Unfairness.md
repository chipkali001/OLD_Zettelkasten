if you're going to sit there and accept the basis that

we're going to cheat in a basic basketball game that people cheat in football games achieve people cheating poker and people cheating all this

[ __ ] and then say no but they're not going to cheat to control the world and you're asinine it's all a [ __ ] lie

the reason i said that is because firstly i live in romania which is a beautiful country full of beautiful people i was living there and people

often see me why'd you live in a corrupt country and my argument was every country is corrupt if you think america is not corrupt you

are living in a bubble the world is corrupt england's corrupt they're all corrupt the eu is corrupt russia is

corrupt every country is corrupt i would rather live in a corrupt country considering that they're all corrupt

with corruption that's more accessible to myself than in a country where they're going to pretend there's law and order unless you reach a certain level

and then you can access the corruption 

humans are corrupt every single institution on the

face of the planet that is run by humans which is currently all of them at some degree is corrupt all of them whether it's doctors financial judicial law and

order the monetary system it's all completely and artly corrupt and to sit here and believe that any of them are

just and fair i think we've just learned in the last few years so we can see that even simple things like keeping people alive even medicine is completely

corrupt from head to toe all of it is so you have to understand that and then you have to look at the chess board and go okay if it's all completely not really

corrupt and i understand that there are certain people who get to play the game on cheat mode.

 i have absolute respect for the country i live this is just human nature this is the nature of systems and how they work and the nature

of the first world second world third world this is just how the world works

 if you accept that in a basic pickup

game of basketball for ten thousand dollars without referees and judges humans are going to naturally avert to cheating to make sure they win do you

think the people who are in charge of the world for the power and control of the entire populace and all of his

resources are not going to consider cheating to win do you think it's not going to cross their mind to just go you know what

let's just change this a little bit i was thinking you're gonna sit there and believe no it's fair

nothing is fair it's nothing has ever been fair i've if you've lived a life of genuine hardship the first thing you

will learn is that nothing is ever fair i've never seen a fair fight on the street i've never seen a fair

relationship i've never seen a [ __ ] person lose his girlfriend or lose her husband fairly i've never seen a fair incident on the [ __ ] road when

someone gets crushed by a truck the world is a very unfair place and humans come along and we purport this idea

don't worry if we're in charge we'll make it fair it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] nothing is ever ever fair and the human

inclination is to win as it should be and the more powerful you are and the higher the stakes the higher inclination to win as it should be this is human

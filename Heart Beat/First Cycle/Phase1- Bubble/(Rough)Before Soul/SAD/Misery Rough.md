Tags: #Melancholy 

In childhood earlier than 4th-5th class.

There was nalla in front of entrance ot my gully and i will think of how fun it will be to just throw my bicycle. It was not frustation but was, you know the world is so wrong and everything should burn to dust. Anger towards my parents, friends, world, existence and God itself.

There were lot of times where i will feel it will be so fun if, i was born a orphan, ibwill be free and so joyful.

If my parents were to die i would be free but i will drag myself out of my fantasies by thinking, what i am thinking is bad.

There were times i will feel that if i take a knife and pierce my heart using that but i would sometimes even grab knife play with it but i knew internally i was too coward and afraid of pain, i will never kill myself.

In nursery, lkg, maybe ukg there were animals on walls i usd to fear them, i didnt liked it & used to fear them lot

One of the fondest memory that comes to my mind is i had a friend Abhay i made in lkg, ukg, 1st class range, i remember the three( me, ayush, abhay) of us were circling around in class throwing water at each other.

I also have memory of feeling disheartened when i went up in class and there was still those monsters on walls

Ayush fought for exam defeated

The time of Clash of clans, before sleeping everyday i used to look forward to next day, made COC so much fun. All friends played COC, it was online multiplayer. the first game ever we can play together and compete with each other, who becomes the best first

YOU DON’T HAVE SAMNE CHILDHOOD, UPBRINGING AND MENTALITY THAN ME  SO IT’S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO CONVEY WITH JUST WORDS, JUST HOW PAINFUL IT WAS.


I envied  (PART OF), 
1) parth bhiya
2) he had lot of friends and just way everyone treated him felt like something i will want to feel what will it be like.
I wanted to be noticed and seen, i used to think maybe it's because he is high rank in study in top 3.
And i am nowhere near.
I wanted to get above him so i will be seen.
(I waited to go home and play video games)
3) 5th class i was very very happy, i misunderstood for so long why i was happy.
Earlier i blamed school that school was bad and blah blah.
But that wasn't the point.
It was that i felt acknowledged and seen by teachers and other kids in my class i felt seen like i am someone and sense of belonging which i wanted to feel in CJC, i saw ayush as a part of this.
In stanford i was praised for my efforts in study.
That need deep inside of me which was unfulfilled for so long was finally fulfilled
4) Even in stanford he seemed to mesh well and felt like more part of class than i was, i was so envious AND AND THAT EXPLAINS THE ANGER TOO WITH COC, when everyone in my class was playing what i used to PLAY, I WAS NO LONGER ALLOWED, when i thought i could finally be part of group. OPPORTUNITY WAS PLUCKED FROM ME.
Opportunity that would have given me so much joy perhaps i would have suffered far less loneliness, pain, abandonment type feeling.
	They all felt so connected and integrated part, they shared common unerstanding knowledge that i didnt understand but wanted to be part of.
	They collectively share so many things important to htier identity but my mother-father didnt did proper job if putting them in me, they both themselves suck in friendship 
	

FROM COC INCIDENT, I FEEL SO ABUSED & ASSAULTED BY PARENTS. THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME & EXPLOITED ME. IN THAT PLACE I EXPRECTED THEM TO STAND UP FOR ME, INSTEAD THEY ABANDONED AND HUMILIATED ME.
EVEN THOUGH MY LIFE, I HAVE BEEN PURE TO THEM IN EVERY ASPECT BUT I FELT ABANDONMENT, they didnt see or try to understnad who i was, they were too busy imposing some image on me.

With all my friends they all imposed kind of image on me, and it made me feel like cartoon at lot of times.
With Ayush too in that case it felt like abandonment, i shouldnt have associated with him in first place.







MY mom dad’s that way of actying

Befrore 8th class, i was very reserved kid, combind with fact that i had my friend ayush, now in front of Ayush i have to appear innocent, like i have never seen or know what porn is? I don't feel any attraction to girls. I remember telling him at young age girls are eww disgusting, 

I will never marry. All my friends saw me as innocent kid who  only care about study, 

Gali gande bche dete hain

I also had image of being sanskari student that i was playing for my parent. Last thing i started readiong book - POWER OF UNCONSIOUS MIND becoz of which i enetered into temporary frenzy of confidence. I believed universe works for me and blah blah destiny, blah blah

In 8th class beginning ayush father died and it was tipping point.

I no longer had to act and play games anymore so i broke little of my shell (not fully out of my shell) but i was free & REALLY REALLY HAPPY. GENUIENLY HAPPY

 i have finally realised that it was IIT-JEE that gave me the strength and courage to push forward thorugh 9 & 10th. 

I was able to bear everything because of having goal, i had something to latch onto.

In childhood i used to believe there is some kind of divine/ godly spirit that keeps the score of everything and i really really believed in it deeply.

That’s why i should never lie to anyone, help others and basically do good deeds and if i continue doing good deeds god will reward me.

I actually recall an incident of 1st class. It was the time when i was deeply worried or say deeply wanted. I wanted to become monitor. Monitors used to get a blue colour batch in CJC and they were called to stage and given the batch so i thought it is really cool. I wanted that, but monitor used to be students who were super good in studies and i used to study and work really hard in that age  without anyone bossing me to do it. But i guess the distance between them and me in subject knowledge was almost unbridgeable.

Well so continuing with the story. I used to always pray to god before sleeping or while trying to sleep that god please ‘make me monitor’ ‘please grant my wish. I will ask for nothing more ever in my life please make me monitor’

Then one day it happened. I don't remember the exact details of the day but i was punished for something. (Like i said i don't remember exactly everything is vague and foggy. I can only tell the key moments) but i was honest to mam and tell everything i did without lying since I used to be a morally upright person because I believed in god. 

Mam was impressed by my honesty and she made me monitor and actually somewhere i knew i was acting morally upright cuz its good and i will be rewarded for it cuz hat’s what i heard from the story.

I got to become a monitor. I was happy for few days but horror started.

As monitor its my duty to get keys from counter and attendence register and the counter was next to principle office. CJC was a super strict school and teachers used to often beat us for no reason. 

And i didnt had the monitor badge yet on top of that cuz mam told me that she will give me that later. 

I think i wanted that badge more than anything so i can boast to my friends and other but i didnt got that and that really disappointed me.

I was very very scared and everyday before sleeping i used tp pray to the same god that please take this monitor position away from me.

And god once again responded. My best friend Ayush, who was an ex-monitor, got the key for me but told me ‘i had to get key myself in future’ something like that.

But i was too scared to pull something scary like that myself so i did bring keys and register myself 1 day but most of the times i didnt and mam will scold me each day for not getyting key. I will apologize and say i forgot then before sleeping i will pray to god ‘please save me. I will ask for nothing more ever in my life please save me’ till i sleep.

And my call was heard once again and mam removed me from being monitor cuz i never did any of my duties rightly but for the time i was. I got to write name of kids and sometimes they used to get beaten and sometimes not. When mam dismissed me from being monitor i was overjoyed. Pheraps the most happy and light i have felt upto that moment cuz i still remember it. I felt like i was in air and from then i was so so greatful to god.

But i guess bad days made lose my faith in god slowly slowly. The paranoia grew slowly. I used to think if there is real good why will he subject me to this torture. I never wished bad for anybody and always try my best to be good then why i am being punished like this. I hoped maybe god will save me but i guess it was stupid thing to cling to as it only prolongs suffering.

Main bhagwan ko kosta tha bhot. Dhire dhire main bhagwan ko fir hate krne lge

A lot of colours that uded to be in my visible range has just vanished and i don't think i would ever be able to recover them.

I 

In 9,10th class i felt whatever i had build up till now collapse

My school friends, friends who were in colony and even the online friends with whom i used to play games and talk stuff.

I like playing video games but now here i can't even do that cause internet is so shitty. 

Just everything has been taken away and whatever the remenants of it are crumbling and will fade away soon.

And i don't have anything to show for these years of life to myself. I mean i can tell others stories about my memories but what stories am i going to tell myself? 

I can get some escape and even some temporary happiness but that willnt fill me. In the end it feels like the path of enjoyment and happiness isn't for me.

First week alone

Last week principal but till no friends

Eventually after 2-3 months made friends

Talking behind back and sharing things to others that didn't want them to share

Didn't like them but had no choice but to ignore everything.

My mother asked me how school is?

I said it’s okay, I don't know how to explain and my pride won't let me admit my weakness

Got Hope i will get to go back to old school and enjoy my youth

Next few months were peaceful I convinced myself  that I will finally get chance to get out of this hell

Next few months were peaceful  but then mom casually told me that we are staying here.

I threw a fit that i don't want to stay here & I don’t like this place. New school is no fun.

Father got into some bad arguments with people from the old place so we can’t also because the admission fee of school is very high and they had paid huge money to get my brother into school who failed in entrance exam and bcoz of the flat case there is financial problem & mom not getting salary problem.

‘I couldn't talk back’

I still had problem with my father but was told me to focus on my exam and bought the topic of the 2nd PTM (we can't go to the first PTM)  where I got accused for no reason.(That me couldn't even imagine saying something like that) later discovered that (XYZ sent the blame on me)

I still remember my mother’s words ‘Agrim tumse aaisa expect nhi kiya tha’ with disappointment

(I have always been a topper in my previous school but in the new school,I wasnt even in top My grades were low because of my weak english hindi sst so probably mene jb unhe kha kki mene kuch nhi kaha to mummy papa ko excuse hi lga hoga)

I have always been a good boy and never a situation came where i disappointed my parents

I distanced myself from toxic friends and started sitting alone

In school I used to remember how amazing my life used to be old school and now I will never get chance to enjoy school

(UPTO 7th class I will say I haven't lived even one day of my school, I used to spend time studying studying, following every rule of school, and everyone else is bad for not following them, not talk to much people except 2 friends, it was only in 8th class I made lot of amazing friends, It was best year of my life, we had a lot of fun and I will say that I enjoyed each and every day of that year we did a lot of mischief)

And now from so many amazing friends who were good people, now I am at a point where I

have no friends

I stopped eating lunch in school because it felt pathetic to be the only one sitting and eating alone. I used to eat lunch in the car once school finished after 2pm.

I hated going to school, my classmates, my parents, everyone but I always had to hide my weak self behind a mask and not show my weak, pitiful self to anyone.

Just give a smile and tell them some made up stories if my parents or relatives asked about new school and in school sitting at the last desk and solving questions pretending that I don't care about socializing and other stuff.

In school I used to get nostalgic seeing others enjoying talking with each other and cry many times by burying my face in my arms. And if some teacher asked me, what's wrong? I have a headache.

I wanted someone to talk to and express my worries, when I talked with my childhood friends from my old school as I never knew how I should express myself, no one has ever taught me that. I didn't have any words to express myself.

I now know how to express myself during that time I didn’t knew anything jaise during pretending in front of my parent relatives and everyone it was not like ki yes I will ‘pretend play’ in front of them. I was confused and didn’t knew what was happening 

I hated my school, and most of all my parents.

I blamed them for everything.

I used to wonder if they were my parents. At least they should know that I am depressed at least if no-one they should be understanding.

I wanted for everything to be normal

I have normal friends

Normal childhood

Normal school friends, we will hang around, play games, talk about nonsense stuff

Yet everything I believed to be normally has been stripped of me.

I don't have any friends

I can't talk properly because I am defective (thats what i told myself)

There is problem in bone alignment in one of my leg due to which i used to walk little strangely and doing things that will put jerk on my knees isn't good and

I felt hopeless for the future as I know people will continue to make fun of me even in the future. I mean I can't talk properly with people, walk strangely and can't speak clearly.

I was also getting fat and got red stretch marks on my shoulder and belly

I wanted nothing more than to die but never had enough courage to do anything.i still have my family financial condition to solve

I used to wonder how brave those kids are who actually do sucide and still feels respect for them for some strange twisted reason.

Class 9th somehow khatam hui and class 10 start hui pr lockdown aa gaya

Also nothing was going well in my study for jee. I used to study day and night, but the backlog was piling up. I didn't do revision and focus on the backlog.

And due to lack of revision I realised all the effort I put in 9th in study has gone to waste because I never revised and now I cant even solve questions which were easy to me earlier.

But by  that time crying was just a normal thing so I don't know the date of this event.

Also around that time I had discussion with my mom of how will I study I should study do dummy school from UP because that will help me in getting state reservation and doing it from school of kota will have lot of competition and rajasthan dont have much good  for iit

In which my mom told ki (exacts words  yaad nhi han)

top 3000-4000 maan rank nhi aati han to acha collge and branch milta hai bhot saare bchee 6th class see coaching karte hain, 13th ke bcche hote hain and kyuki mai koi talented nhi hun mene sab kuch hard work pe kiya haan.

I found anime and distracted myself with it but usme bhi papa scold me for spending 2 hours watching anime while eating.

According to  him me who was sleeping 5 hours and studying rest of day should study more harder because 10th marks are important and i am main focusing on jee and if i odnt want to do that then i should sleep and dont watch this.

and was able to forget about sad things for time until diwali came.

Phir diwali aayi 10th class ki

One of them used to be my favourite day of the year. I love to  draw rangoli and other things and get nostalgic again.

But patake chune ka bhi man nhi kr rha tha aur feel ho rha tha aur maan apne aapa ko rone see barely rok rha tha ek do ptake chutne kee bad mene kha ki main yee sb baad maan chutunga.

Phir meen 1-2 bje tk chadar ke andar ghus kr roya tha diwali ko.

Aaise hi time beetta gaya

Jo mere old childhood friends thee who bhi utna bhaw nhi dete these meri memes or message ko seen krne kee baad 1-2 din baad kbhi reply krte kyuki wo sb lockdown maan bahut busy thee.

It’s not like I blame them, after all I was just a boring person, I used to study and watch anime. Also as time passes the old friends lose significance and you get better new ones to replace them.

I didn't want to feel more humiliated and out of frustration I deleted all my social media apps.

I had a lot lot of dreams in which I get belittled by lot of friends.

I kept myself distracted in anime but a few weeks later my mom asked about my friends so I said I uninstalled social media to focus more.

In noon while I was eating dinner and watching anime then my father came took my phone away and started teaching me importance of friends, I was frustrated and angry, I talked back and father started saying ki I have become  mad for anime. If I  have time to do this then i should talk and mom came she also start giving me preaching.

I stopped  watching anime while eating and instead in night when everybody used to sleep then I used to watch anime due to which my backlog increased and I eventually gave up and divided. I will start studying for JEE in my 11th.

I didnt celebrate holi that year because i had no friends. It was heartwrenching.

On the 11th I will get to go to coaching and a hostel away from this shitty place I call my home.

Got frustated. Nothing was making sense.All my thoughts were in confusion. I was in depression for so long and i felt that i wont be able to express this to  anyone because i myself dont  understand and i have to be alone for rest of my life because nothing was feeling good. Food feels bland and everyhing was gloomy.

We even went for a trip to some hill station but even there i hated every single minute of journey and place. I just wanted an empty and alone place where i can hide myself.

I was already so boring person and now on top of that now i hate travelling.

I will never be able to fit in anywhere.

I hoped atleast my mom and dad will understand me after all i have been their good kid who do everything as they said to me till now.

In those times when mother and father tookte thee me at everything and I was already in frustration and depressed mood. There was not one but many day when i will start crying when they will scold after  that my father will laugh at me and say ki itna bada 11th ka bacha bhi rota hee iski photo khicho aur mere bhai see phone lane ko khenge.

It was not his fault he has never been through same condition as me and think he was just trying to uplift  my mood by making me laugh.

I started hating everyone my father, my mother, my old friends and felt totally isolated

I was getting low marks in tests and backlog keep on piling up and my depression of cheery on the top. I didnt had any room where i will left alone for whole time and concentrate. I used to study in drawing room and everyone used to go through my room nth times sometimes it uncle jo kaam krte haan. Kbhi koi papa ke office ka koi hoga, there was electricity problem so my brother also used to sit with me because otherwise our battery will get drained and we wont be able to run fans at night.

I was just hoping that i would get some way to escape from this hell when i get to kota but my it kept on delaying due to corona

And soon after that my grandfather got paralysis so my chacha and 2 cousin bhiya unko mere ghar pee laaye thee kyuki mere ghar see 20 min duri pr hospital haan.

Aur phir jab utne chote see ghar mee itne

I was already having trouble concentrating and now sweet 5 more people (my grandfather grandmother chacha two cousins) in my house and then having no alone place to study

When i complained to father he said i should learn to adjust everything in life dont go as you want.

And even after few weeks when chacha  and 2 cousin brother left my troubles only increase because now i also have to take care of my grandfather because his brain was little haywired even though he recovered from paralysis  and he needed someone to help him with toilet and other stuff.

And in night i used to wake up and study so i was the most convenient option.

In moring when i used to sleep my grandparents will go inside out multiple time, door will produce  sound. Our kaam wale uncle will go inside out multiple time to give things to dadaji and dadi, for crops and everywork, my father used to come multiple time from his office too  which will disturb my sleep i was already sleeping for  5-6 hours only and even that i cant get complete.

My backlog became so much that now i thought that if i go to kota i will be wasting many months just to get settle and i have already lost all desire to engage socially because i know i was pathetic and boring person.

I mean, first thing - i have already forget how to talk to people due to 2 years of no social contact with friend

Second thing - i hated everything and was depressing, gloomy and negative person

Third thing - I have lot of backlog and everyone will consider me loser who don't study

And i had my insecurities about my totlapan

I was joke of a human being

I didn't wanted, someone to point at my flaws.

I just wanted to stay in my cocoon (my home) so that no one will see me

Ah, I forgot about novels.

When I discovered light novels, it was a life saving discovery for me.

I used to love isekai because the protagonist will be a loser in his previous life but in his next life everything he wants will come to him.

It felt really good, I can't begin to describe it to you.

I decided that maybe i will write my own novels too after reading many novels.

I wrote my first novel and wasted time.

It got some good comments which made me really happy but then i got two review critising how bad grammar is, how empty and bland characters are, and blah blah .

I even sacrificed jee prep time  even though i had so much backlog.

That thing finally broke me out of my illusion.

I came to view with my reality . (Psychotic break is term for this)

I deleted my novel along with account.

I was Cheating in coaching test but still ranked 250-300/700. It felt like the after hardworking for last 3 years yet no results to show. I was betraying my parents and that thing made me hate myself more and feel more guilt

Sleeping and eating a lot was my escape after that

Slowly my interest in subjects got restored by march and mental condition satabilized. I was not depressed anyomre 

My first few weeks and months in new school was disappointing.

I didn't made friends for a long time.

I couldn't connect.

Also the culture were different, people in haryana Stanford school were wild. They didn't cared about studies at all and in boys it was only 1 variable student beside me who was bit serious about students. They all were free souls. None of them cred about rules or getting caught and punished and i just admired them a lot. I was too much of a pussy and i just found them cool. I don't want complain to go to my house cause it will taint image of my sincere child.

But after class8 was over i have decided that  i am going to enjoy these two years i have to fullest cause after that i will go to Kota and willnt have chance of going to school. So i am going to make lot of memories here. I will not care if teacher complain or whatever. 

However the new school was rigid and strict and the kids were the same. They were all civilised or normal.

I found them kind of boring, but i didn't have word boring in my mind, so i just felt that i don't belong here.

I had lot of friends back at home that i really enjoy company of and talking to

Friends in my gully and friends in school with whom i have been for long time so the shift from having a lot of friends to sudden having everything just stripped away was painful and i felt remorsful that my precious 9th and 10th class. I will not get to have good memories.

I really had a very strong faith in God and a strong sense of destiny (everything happens for a reason).

So i just thought this is so that god can show me the value of the Friendships.

Cause deprevation is the only way you understand real value of stuff.

 and maybe i have enjoyed my 8th class bit too much ( the last 8-9 months, were the happiest i ever felt in my life. I was so excited and happy to school ebryday, world was so so rosy. I had lot of experience like getting to eating with my crush, playing different games together, emotionally blackmailing teachers to get games period, we had lot of weeks where we were going to ground 2-3 times a day and it was just amazing.) .

I have used too much of my positive karma so i am in some sort or debt so god is trying to even out stuff by giving me equal sadness and misery for the happiness he bestowed upon me in the last year.

So that allowed me to bear the pain of isolation, broken dream of enjoying my 9th and 10th, lying to my parent when they ask about my friends in new school. Evrything was bearable though sometimes me bhagwan ko Kosta tha ki why cant i have just a normal life, i don't have done anything to recieve your judgement. And actually my cries were answered for.short time.

I remember it was art period (some kids go to singing, some to music, some for art)

So for art we have to go to different section and in that all sections students were combined in one class and class used to be super messy. Everything is spread on desks, etc

 and it was basically a free period.

I will find a desk where i can sit alone in middle position cause mam used to pay super attention to kids who sat on back so sitting in middle seat but not in middle row helped me blend in crowd.

 i will just sit and solve maths, physics 11th module questions secretly and on top i will pretend to draw when mam comes near me and since class was messy i can keep the book on left side and mam willnt suspect anything she will think it's book of some other kid.

So when i was solving questions like normal days.

My first two friends talked to me, actually the two of them were interested in iit preparation too so we were able to become friends quickly and apparently remember when i said that i found people in class boring but the two of them were the most funny and troublemaking and harami type. 

I mean whats the coincidence of this happening so i though maybe god has blessed me.

Initially kartike and i were good friends cuz 

He wanted to go to iit after 12. 

After us metting and becoming friends. I encouraged him doing class11-12 maths physics.

And he was serious too, other one (SHubhankar) said he will do but ultimately he didnt do anything nor buy books.

So i talked with kartike more and we became close friends and class was starting to feel little fun. 

He even said to me something  like  ‘you are my best friend and i neverd had friend like you in my life and he was happy (I dont remember exact words but it really made me feel so happy and i was feeling that much happiness after so much long time of misery and pain’

[**No need to say this neccesrly**I have listened a line. You will not understand a person fully until you have a serious argument with other human. The other human may act like they are best people in world but you learn what they are really made of when you have serious argument] 

One day i was sharing him how it felt like everything happens for a reason and it feels like if things havent proceeded the way they did, i cant imagine a future where i will be in a better situation than i currently am.’

He shared to me he realized that thing long time ago. (EGOISTICAL STATEMENT BUT I WASN’T SMART ENOUGH TO NOTICE AND UNDERSTAND)

 He also felt like everything just happened to smoothly to be considered natural. And he thanked me by saying if he hadn't met me most likely he would be wasting time but now he is doing something productive. (I only remember this thing cause him praising me made me happy so i remembe4r it everything else is foggy)

I really dont know how things happened next but we happened to have lot, lots of ego fight between us.

Over everything. Maths like what is log0 or something like that or 

God- my belief was there is some superior force that guides all and that thing cant be named or talked about by us mere mortal human beings, its out of our understanding. And these names that humans speak of are all bullshit and crap created by humans. Cause human will make his gods like human or base it on animals that he sees around like monkey and elephant. I guess me saying like that would have hurt his sentiments. (And i was trying to say in a tone that will  He began to send me youtbe videos where hanumanji was captured in video and photo of mountain and showed me faces of humans in it saying that it belongs to shiva and its a proof. I responded that you will try to look through an lens fore something then it will be all you see, this is all your imagination. He also shared internet pages where it was written shiva have infinite forms but i just replied why will god mingle with humans, he should beyond such things where he comes and play with humans and even he is interfering why would we want to spread name about him and be noisy.

And our friendship just deteriorated from thereon and my mental health too slowly degraded cause i lost the illusional friend 

BUT THAT TIME I HAD VERY STRONG SENES OF FATE THAT UNIVERSE IS WORKING FOR ME, because everything that has happened to me has to happen in very very speci way, and infinite coincidences, plus i also read first book of my life PowerOfSubconsiousMind ,

The strong sense of fate was the strongest defense and drive/motivation mechanism for me.

It gave me lot of strength to not to get bogged down by shame that much and cling to it.

BUT I  GUESS it was more of double edged sword, holding onto hope that universe will pull me out and make me happy. Bring me justice, THE MORE CLINGING ONTO HOPE only prolonged the suffering and pain.

LOSING FAITH IN THAT PROTECTIVE SHIELD UNGED ME INTO ANGER/FRUSTATION/LotOfHate  and i got pused to victim mentallity now.

Ny source of joy - video games and cartoon (computer don’;t work and Net was slow, i ran out of shinchan episodes)

MyHobby - Making The game, learning 3d moddelling

First week alone

Last week principal but till no friends

WHen my mother asked about school and friends. I will say yes i talked to few, but i didn’t talk much 

I lied obviously and you know when they will ask me, i will feel so much shame, there is something wrong in me for not even being able to make few friends.

I wanted to tell my old friends good and happy story, not i am so sad and lonely~ look at me~ comfort and love me~

Eventually after 2-3 months made friends

Talking behind back and sharing things to others that didn't want them to share

Didn't like them but had no choice but to ignore everything. 

My mother asked me how school is? 

I said it’s okay, I don't know how to explain and my pride won't let me admit my weakness

Got Hope i will get to go back to old school and enjoy my youth

Next few months were peaceful I convinced myself  that I will finally get chance to get out of this hell

Next few months were peaceful  but then mom casually told me that we are staying here.

I threw a fit that i don't want to stay here & I don’t like this place. New school is no fun.

Father got into some bad arguments with people from the old place so we can’t also because the admission fee of school is very high and they had paid huge money to get my brother into school who failed in entrance exam and bcoz of the flat case there is financial problem & mom not getting salary problem. 

‘I couldn't talk back’

In this time frustration was building up, my brother was unaffected, the same thing has happened to both of us but he didnt really seem affected to same degree i was. 

I still had problem with my father but was told me to focus on my exam and bought the topic of the 2nd PTM (we can't go to the first PTM)  where I got accused for no reason.(That me couldn't even imagine saying something like that) later discovered that (XYZ sent the blame on me) 

I still remember my mother’s words ‘Agrim tumse aaisa expect nhi kiya tha’ with disappointment 

(I have always been a topper in my previous school but in the new school,I wasnt even in top My grades were low because of my weak english hindi sst so probably mene jb unhe kha kki mene kuch nhi kaha to mummy papa ko excuse hi lga hoga) 

I have always been a good boy and never a situation came where i disappointed my parents

I distanced myself from toxic friends and started sitting alone

In school I used to remember how amazing my life used to be old school and now I will never get chance to enjoy school

(UPTO 7th class I will say I haven't lived even one day of my school, I used to spend time studying studying, following every rule of school, and everyone else is bad for not following them, not talk to much people except 2 friends, it was only in 8th class I made lot of amazing friends, It was best year of my life, we had a lot of fun and I will say that I enjoyed each and every day of that year we did a lot of mischief)

And now from so many amazing friends who were good people, now I am at a point where I 

have no friends

I stopped eating lunch in school because it felt pathetic to be the only one sitting and eating alone. I used to eat lunch in the car once school finished after 2pm.

I hated going to school, my classmates, my parents, everyone but I always had to hide my weak self behind a mask and not show my weak, pitiful self to anyone.

Just give a smile and tell them some made up stories if my parents or relatives asked about new school and in school sitting at the last desk and solving questions pretending that I don't care about socialising and other stuff.

In school I used to get nostalgic seeing others enjoying talking with each other and cry many times by burying my face in my arms. And if some teacher asked me, what's wrong? I have a headache. 

I wanted someone to talk to and express my worries, when I talked with my childhood friends from my old school as I never knew how I should express myself, no one has ever taught me that. I didn't have any words to express myself.

But it felt nice, time to time talking with them

I now know how to express myself during that time I didn’t knew anything jaise during pretending in front of my parent relatives and everyone it was not like ki yes I will ‘pretend play’ in front of them. I was confused and didn’t knew what was happening and that was the reflexive resonse .

Time ke saath

Jo mere old childhood friends thee who bhi utna bhaw nhi dete these meri memes or message ko seen krne kee baad 1-2 din baad kbhi reply krte kyuki wo sb lockdown maan bahut busy thee.

It’s not like I blame them, after all I was just a boring person, I used to study and watch anime. Also as time passes the old friends lose significance and you get better new ones to replace them. But i felt so so so much betrayed that, i valued them so much in my life but they are like this.

I didn't want to feel more humiliated and out of frustration I deleted all my social media apps.

I hated my school, my old friends, my new friends, and most of all my parents.

I blamed them for everything.

I used to wonder if they were my parents. At least they should know that I am depressed at least if no-one they should be understanding.

I wanted for everything to be normal

I have normal friends

Normal childhood

Normal school friends, we will hang around, play games, talk about nonsense stuff

Yet everything I believed to be normally has been stripped of me.

I don't have any friends

I can't talk properly because I am defective (thats what i told myself)

There is problem in bone alignment in one of my leg due to which i used to walk little strangely and doing things that will put jerk on my knees isn't good and 

I felt hopeless for the future as I know people will continue to make fun of me even in the future. I mean I can't talk properly with people, walk strangely and can't speak clearly.

I was also getting fat and got red stretch marks on my shoulder and belly

I wanted nothing more than to die but never had enough courage to do anything.i still have my family financial condition to solve

I used to wonder how brave those kids are who actually do sucide and still feels respect for them for some strange twisted reason.

Class 9th somehow khatam hui and class 10 start hui pr lockdown aa gaya

Also nothing was going well in my study for jee. I used to study day and night, but the backlog was piling up. I didn't do revision and focus on the backlog. 

And due to lack of revision I realised all the effort I put in 9th in study has gone to waste because I never revised and now I cant even solve questions which were easy to me earlier.

But by  that time crying was just a normal thing so I don't know the date of this event.

Also around that time I had discussion with my mom of how will I study I should study do dummy school from UP because that will help me in getting state reservation and doing it from school of kota will have lot of competition and rajasthan dont have much good  for iit 

I found anime and distracted myself with it but usme bhi papa scold me (30min daily while eat) for spending 2 hours watching anime while eating.

That was the only social link i was receiving Huh. 

I WAS DILIGENT AND COMPLACENT KID IN CHILDHOOD  SO I DEPENDED A LOT ON MY MY MTOHER AND FATHER'S APPROVAL. THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME SO GETTING TAUNT AFFECTEED MORE THAN A NORAM LEPRSON WOULD HAVE

According to  him me who was sleeping 5 hours and studying rest of day should study more harder because 10th marks are important and i am main focusing on jee and if i odnt want to do that then i should sleep and dont watch this.

I just wanted to keep sleeping continuously. Because sleeping was the only the thing that will comfort me from the pain  that was bugging me.

And when after too much sleep i won't be able to sleep then i would just go fill myselg till i feel bloated and then it will be easier to sleep or maybe using masturbation as a way to deflect the shame and guilt i was feeling.

I don't have to conforont anything in my head my that way but that wasn't really efficient but i guess novels really gave me so much help today.

I got hope that nothing needs to change/improve about me everything is okay. As long as i have a novel to read i can immerse myself in another world and forget about this one. I just want a small room, laptop and comfortable bed. As long as i have that i will be able to enjoy my life and i really believe that will be enough to make me happy. So that made my worries irrelevant cause i no longer need friendship or a super highpaying job, any normal job would be able to fill my desire for 1 laptop, internet, small room and a comfortable bed and besides i knew how am i supposed to prepare each subject so even if i give 4-5 hours daily to study, exam is after  2 years so w rank under 1000 easily guarentee.

So for nearly 20-30 days after that i was really happy. I would read novels all day long and it was really fulfilling. My world view wasn't really formed at that age so it was easy to believ in that dream

and was able to forget about sad things for time until diwali came.

Phir diwali aayi 10th class ki

One of them used to be my favourite day of the year. I love to  draw rangoli and other things and get nostalgic again.

But patake chune ka bhi man nhi kr rha tha aur feel ho rha tha aur maan apne aapa ko rone see barely rok rha tha ek do ptake chutne kee bad mene kha ki main yee sb baad maan chutunga.

Phir meen 1-2 bje tk chadar ke andar ghus kr roya tha diwali ko.

I had a lot lot of dreams in which I get belittled by lot of friends.

Now, i hated my mother, father, friends, new friends, school everything.

I kept myself distracted in anime but a few weeks later my mom asked about my friends so I said I uninstalled social media to focus more. 

In noon while I was eating dinner and watching anime then my father came took my phone away and started teaching me importance of friends, I was frustrated and angry, I talked back and father started saying ki I have become  mad for anime. If I  have time to do this then i should talk and mom came she also start giving me preaching.

(i didn t have eye to listen to what hey are saying, cause i was in spiral -ve mode first, anime my only sense of relief and he is interuppting me in my happy time, and he wants me to make friends while keeping me locked. AND THEY ARE BELITTLING AND SPITTING ON WHAT I CONSIDER MY ONLY SAVING GRACE THROUGH ALL THIS PAIN. SO I SAW IT AS THEM ATTACKING ME TO  SATISFY THERI EGO WHICH IT WAS, ATLEAST WAHT FATHER DID)

I stopped  watching anime while eating and instead in night when everybody used to sleep then I used to watch anime due to which my backlog increased and I eventually gave up and divided. I will start studying for JEE in my 11th. I was so eager to go away from this place.

I actually ever since in 5th- 6th class i heard of kota, i was so excited.

I didn’t had anyone around me who shared same passion in maths & science , actually noone even cared fro studies so i felt that kind of loneliness that noone with same value for my goal is there, when i first heard about kota and coaching iw was so excited that i will get chance to be around people like me.

In 9,10th all i wanted was time to pass fastly, so i can go to kota

I told my my father to buy batch of maybe june july , i had planned how i will do things and bu june july, till then i will revise old stuff and learn fwe thuings here there soi will be ahead of syllabus, i will get cahnce to offline coaching and just go away from this filthy place, i hated my house so much and i just wanted to get away from here, i hated my house so so much. my father instead bought the most earliest batch and when i gfound out i was furious because myt plans were ruined and just out of resentment i didn't watched anything or any lecture, i jusdt checked notes pdf and i ahd covered initial chapters before, i gave first 3-4 test sincerly after that i dint used syllabus and filled answer through checking on net by cheating, i never ever in entire course watched a full lecture., but later depression grew and i just didnt had courage to go when given chance even though ever since we first came here, i just wamted to go way from here.

I actually had two friends at different different time one in 6th,7th and other in 9th but both were full extroverted narcissists & were cause of lot of suffering. 

I didnt celebrate holi that year because i had no friends. It was heartwrenching.

On the 11th I will get to go to coaching and a hostel away from this shitty place I call my home.

Father & mother let me go early when it was opening saying that cases will be there, but i was desperate about wanting to get away from here and also, there was fact that if i went there after 3-4 months then i will stick out like sore thumb and everyone would already have formed friend circle , i didnt how to talk, atleast if everyone is in same condition i can somehow manage.

and we normally place mothre & father as upbut i hated them and lost all respect i had for them

Got frustated. Nothing was making sense.All my thoughts were in confusion. I was in depression for so long and i felt that i wont be able to express this to  anyone because i myself dont  understand and i have to be alone for rest of my life because nothing was feeling good. Food feels bland and everyhing was gloomy.

We even went for a trip to some hill station but even there i hated every single minute of journey and place. I just wanted an empty and alone place where i can hide myself.

I was already so boring person and now on top of that now i hate travelling.

I will never be able to fit in anywhere.

I hoped atleast my mom and dad will understand me after all i have been their good kid who do everything as they said to me till now.

In those times when mother and father tookte thee me at everything and I was already in frustration and depressed mood. There was not one but many day when i will start crying when they will scold after  that my father will laugh at me and say ki itna bada 11th ka bacha bhi rota hee iski photo khicho aur mere bhai see phone lane ko khenge.

It was not his fault he has never been through same condition as me and think he was just trying to uplift  my mood by making me laugh.

I started hating everyone my father, my mother, my old friends and felt totally isolated

I was getting low marks in tests and backlog keep on piling up and my depression of cheery on the top. I didnt had any room where i will left alone for whole time and concentrate. I used to study in drawing room and everyone used to go through my room nth times sometimes it uncle jo kaam krte haan. Kbhi koi papa ke office ka koi hoga, there was electricity problem so my brother also used to sit with me because otherwise our battery will get drained and we wont be able to run fans at night.

I was just hoping that i would get some way to escape from this hell when i get to kota but my it kept on delaying due to corona

And soon after that my grandfather got paralysis so my chacha and 2 cousin bhiya unko mere ghar pee laaye thee kyuki mere ghar see 20 min duri pr hospital haan.

Aur phir jab utne chote see ghar mee itne

I was already having trouble concentrating and now sweet 5 more people (my grandfather grandmother chacha two cousins) in my house and then having no alone place to study 

When i complained to father he said i should learn to adjust everything in life dont go as you want. 

And even after few weeks when chacha  and 2 cousin brother left my troubles only increase because now i also have to take care of my grandfather because his brain was little haywired even though he recovered from paralysis  and he needed someone to help him with toilet and other stuff.

And in night i used to wake up and study so i was the most convenient option.

In moring when i used to sleep my grandparents will go inside out multiple time, door will produce  sound. Our kaam wale uncle will go inside out multiple time to give things to dadaji and dadi, for crops and everywork, my father used to come multiple time from his office too  which will disturb my sleep i was already sleeping for  5-6 hours only and even that i cant get complete.

My backlog became so much that now i thought that if i go to kota i will be wasting many months just to get settle and i have already lost all desire to engage socially because i know i was pathetic and boring person.

I mean, first thing - i have already forget how to talk to people due to 2 years of no social contact with friend

Second thing - i hated everything and was depressing, gloomy and negative person

Third thing - I had my insecurities about my totlapan (With friends it was common to call each other names and jokes, my friend will mimic me whenever i pronounced something weird or will bring back an instant back where i said something wrong, then everyone girls and friends will laugh at me. Some of it was my fault too because maybe i was over sensiti. They will say thisis all for fun. DOnt take it seriously. THough they will occasionally ask “Bura laag gya kya?” “Now imagine if girls, my friends all of them are laughing at me and in that scenario they ask bura laag gya kya? To just admit krna ki ha mujhe lg rha haan bhot humiliating feel hota hain, i will try to just brush it off. ve m”  , my lies and fake marks will be exposed.

I was joke of a human being 

I didn't wanted, someone to point at my flaws.

I just wanted to stay in my cocoon (my home) so that no one will see me .

Aaise hi time beetta gaya 

Ah, I forgot about novels.

When I discovered light novels, it was a life saving discovery for me.

I used to love isekai because the protagonist will be a loser in his previous life but in his next life everything he wants will come to him. 

It felt really good, I can't begin to describe it to you.

I decided that maybe i will write my own novels too after reading many novels.

I wrote my first novel and wasted time.

It got some good comments which made me really happy but then i got two review critising how bad grammar is, how empty and bland characters are, and blah blah .

I even sacrificed jee prep time  even though i had so much backlog.

That thing finally broke me out of my illusion.

I came to view with my reality . (Psychotic break is term for this)

I deleted my novel along with account. 

I was Cheating in coaching test but still ranked 250-300/700. It felt like the after hardworking for last 3 years yet no results to show. I was betraying my parents and that thing made me hate myself more and feel more guilt

Sleeping and eating a lot was my escape after that

Slowly my mental condition satabilized. I was not depressed anyomre   

I was also expecting they are my parents they should be able to read my mind and understand that I am suffering and help me but they are just kicking me around.

I have been wronged by the world and some external force have duty to help me and clinging to that hope for so so long only made it to worse.

Till february i wasnt able to make much progress. Depression was really sticky thing to deal with because i will wake up study for few hours negative thought ,crawl up an d i wont be ablre to study anymore . i only wanted to keep on sleeping because waking up and staying with my thoughts was stay painful. Even in my sleep i used to have nightmare of my friends family member making fu nof me laughing at me. I had 0 strength to do literally anything.

But slowly slowly as i watched about mental health, spirituallity , my mental condition start become clear very littole by little and in duration of ,march to june all i was able to do was revision of all past subjects and rest of time nothing productive. 

There wasn't an easy means for dying and what misery i will afflict on my parents after death, i don't want them to suffer. If i can die and all of traces my existence could be erased then that will be how i want to die.

Maybe i can be die after my parents death well that's sounds fucked up

One of the reason i remember everything so vividly because i used to think of telling this story to soemone and it will give me solace for some time but it couldnt hold anything at bay for long

I also hated, why i cry over these small stuff.

One of the biggest thing that caused lot of suffering was that noone would be able to understand me because here are all these kids who have friend s with who they can laugh enjoy while i will never get the chance to have a normal life. Where i have this speech problem combine with the thing that they are all enjoying their lives whereas i am suffering and couldn't seem to enjoy or find pleasure in the same thing they consider normal

t

The reason for hating my friends was becoz i didn't like talking to people in group. I always love one to one conversation becoz i can develop more stronger friendship that way and i also like to share details about a lot of things and it really makes me angry, if i told something to one person they will share it with others.

 I didn't rebel and pass it off, this is the culture here i guess?

But when i did the same. One of them got really really angry at me that i am this and that. It was hypocritical of him to say that but i was pushover and couldnt say anything. I didn't knew what to say.

Though i used to raise hands in class and answer questions despite my fear. I couldn't understand that fr long time but now i can understand. I used to study very hard, day and night because i wanted to get in top 5, but i never felt anyone acknowledged how much effort i put in for studying. My mother used to praise me by saying me as sincere that i study on my own and they never need to push me to do things which used to make me happily but i badly wanted my efforts to be acknowledge and in Stanford for the first time i got acknowledgement and i really loved when teachers will praise me for knowing though it was soothing for my broken ego but i accepted at the same time rejected their praise becus i felt that no one here except 3 kids spends little effort to study anyways so obviously i will get top 3 rank.

But i guess in the end it was good for me because i developed a more healthy perspective that i may not be as smart as ayush but if i work hard enough i can reach a level where that thing will stop mattering 

I suddenly remember for my 7thish, 8th, 9th i began to think there is something wrong in me and noone will want to spend time with me. i think i really strongly felt it. 

I hated my name for long time. It just added to the feeling that's there's is something biological wrong in me. I remember there were many instances people( bhiyas and a girl)   judged me on basis of my name and associate me with xyz and so it just added to that bundle of emotions. Mentallity in that area was narrow minded.  I couldnt even talk to anyone about it since i thought they will judge em and think of it as small things to be worried over but it was not small thing for me cuz it was linked with this feeling that i am disfigured in some sense, i lacj even the normal things other people have, i am just internally incomplete, mistake

Parth bhiya used to see me judgementally, there were a lot a lot of instances i felt left out or i was not invited. I envied ayush that he was so open and free.

I always envied ayush because we literally have same circumstances but he was able to make friends so much easily. In 3rd 4th he stopped hanging out with me much in school and used to be with the cool kids. I felt betrayed by i him but it wasn't something i was able to quite put into words.

Even in Stanford he was able to make friends so easily in so less time. Everyone admired him that just how easily he can manage both sports and studies

I have managed to link and connec so may things due to this islation .  These things were etched so strongly in my psyce.

In 9thh class. Few words from my friend sticdked with me. One day in lunch, My friend Apoorv(I became friends with apoorv cuz two of my friends used to make fun of him by calling him chakka because he had roll number 6. He did’t had any group or cliche where he belonged and was good in maths. He used to go to foundation course for IIT. That’s why i thought of making him my friend. ) were going to washroom, he said to me “you are a very optimistic person/” I didnt knew meaning of optimistic back then, so when i asked hime what does the word mean. He pointed out t o a board where vocabh words were written i didnt rememberre what was written there but somehow this memories sticked with me.

At that time, i was really the lowest i have been, from the beginning of my life till that moment. This contradiction didn’t made any sense but now i realised

Because my present was shitty, ui didnt liked anything about me that whyi had goals like i will memorise 20 jokes everyday and in 4 years I will have so huge vocab of jokes so that i can finally become interesting person. I will practice speaking by recording myself in audio video so i become good at talking and becoming friends with people. I had a narcissistic friend ( i am or was highly empathic, agreeable and this kind of personality naturally attracts narrsicits that’s what i read in newspaper) and he made me feel small so i thought i will practice and practice and finally reach a level where noone will make me feel small,

English sir told my mom that me, kartike, shubhankar sit back in class and abuse, make fun of teacher and create names. Yee baat unhe kisi baache ne report ki thi.

I was new in school, so sir assumed that mene unhe bigad Diya aur mere ek dost ki mummy see shikayat nhi krdi.

And before that i have always been a sanskari bachha to mummy. Time he homework krne, mummy papa ki baate manna, blah blah.

I was still half good i still believed that teachers are these noble/holy creature so i can delfile these beings by saying something abusive or even just calling out names. 

And i had it subconsciously ingrained in me that gaalis are bad and i would just rarely say them to fight in bezzati battle in hm dost ek dusri ki lete thee.

I still remeber it deeply disappointment in mom words when she said.

"Tumse yee ummid nhi thi"

Always before i have been sanskari kid and mummy ka aacha bcha

Tecaher will praise me for sincerity in all PTM

First i was just finding it difficult to comprehend what is happening cause this will paint an dark spot in my pure image.

I was feeling so much shame and that numbing sensation.

What sir told mom was clearly a lie but that numbness due to shame and heavy atmosphere was making it difficult for me to breathe and just think or say anything.

I began to cry and said sir is lying it's the other two who are bad.

Then mom later asked me not to sit with them.

But i felt mom didn't fully believed in me and it hurted me a lot 

It was a tale of class 3 or class 4. It was the first trip and worst trip of my life, so obviously I was excited beyond words. I wanted to go there together with my best friend with whom i have been friends till i was 1-2yrs old. But he wanted to go with a group of some of his other friends.

I felt betrayed and it was a little saddening for me but I tried to not let that drag me down and asked my other friend who used to sit next me, he too was excited, so we made our plan together, snacks, what we will find each other on day of trip because we used to come to school from different bus, blah blah.

I woke up early because I couldn't sleep due to excitement.

I reached school and what do you think i realised.

That friend of mine didn't come. 

It was just the beginning of the day.

All plans were shattered now and I realised that I will have to go on the trip alone.

But you know when I was kid, I used to be optimistic.

I shifted my attention outside of the window and tried to enjoy the scenic view. I got bored because I had no one to talk to and was tired so I slept. Soon we arrived at the water park.

I don't remember how it looked but it was the first time in my life that i saw a swimming pool. Before that I had only watched it in TV ads.

It was really amazing and all my sadness from the morning really went away.

After the teacher told us the instructions they allowed us to go wherever we wanted to.

There were 4-5 pools where the biggest one was reserved  for adults only.

In the pool I went, a water wave would come in the time intervals but after ‘I don't know’ minutes of initial excitement, I got bored because you know there is so much fun I can have alone.

I looked around and I saw there was a slide wala pool and there were 3 slides in it.

One came straight down in the middle and the other two were spiralling.

They looked big from the ground, which scared me but as you know, I was getting bored and I paid money for the trip, so I am going to enjoy it to the fullest.

Actually there was an age limit board sign near the place where you enter the slide but i didn't notice it and  because i was among the tallest in my class so the people who were shielding the slide from little kids did not consider me an anomaly too.

Also that pool had a special quality which at that time I was not aware of - The pool gets deeper as you go ahead, towards the area where the slides end where it was deepest.

Fufufu

There was big line for the slide and after few minutes was walking slowly and big line my chance was about to come 

 It was a closed area when i was in line so i coulndt take a peek down but now the view from the top of slides was visible and i was scared.

I initially knew that this slide was tall but when i got to the top it was way higher than I expected.

I wanted to run away, really badly, but i have been shy, hesitant to talk to stranger, much less bring attention to myself by standing out and saying i want to go back when there was big line of kids waiting for their turn behind me.

I knew i am fucked (mere laag gaye hain), but i saw  the kid in front of me going there effortlessly.

They can do it, and so can I, I tried to say to myself but I was still scared.

When i sat on slide, someone gave me a slight push and i accelerated so fast in few seconds before i plunged into water which was really deep and I started to drown.  I flapped my arms with full strength to do something but nothing was happening and I was drowning more. I thought I was going to die but then ek lifeguard bhiya saved me by grabbing me by arms and pulling my whole body out with only just my arms.

It was just an indescribable feeling. My whole body was shaking very badly and i just can't describe that dreadful feeling, my body was just petrified

He dropped to a place outside of the pool and he went back. I didn't get to see the face of the person who saved me because i was so occupied with what just happened, i couldn't comprehend anything, my body was just petrified.

I calmed down after little time but my body wouldn't stop shaking, i didn't had the courage to enter the pool again and as around that time after few 10-15 minute our school staffs began to arrange for unch for which i had to sand in long line and wait for 3-40miutes before  got the chance to eat. After lunch a lot of time was still left.

So i tried entering pool again but my whole body was still shaking really badly and i didnt wanted to go near water but it was water park so there wasnt much expect waterpool so. I just sat on the edge of a waterpool which was the least deep and meant for even smaller kids. I waited for hours so that we will leave this place.

When i finally reached home, i lied on bed. My boy was shivering and feeling of almost facing a near death experience was just unberable. I didnt understand what just happened today and everything was so confusing and i just couldnt understand what should i do. I didnt told my parents anything. I cried that night to sleep and did for few days before i got used to it. 

Well looking on optimistic side.

Death is more better thing to cry over than why my friends abandoned me but I guess fear of death overshadowed everything and i remained ignorant and not became paranoid of authenticity of my friendships

In class 1/2/3. I don't remember exactly.  It was a maths period. I was in christian school which was super strict. I have to speak from 20-30. 

I was totla and had trouble pronouncing some sounds but as child i had lot of confidence, which i initially thought got shattered after this incident.

We had sister who used to teach us mathematics.

She ask me standup and say words.

I begin to speak

I think I pronounced it like twenty ‘tenty one’ ‘tenty two’ . She started laughing though she was very strict usually. Kids imitated her and they began to laugh. She asked me to pronunce twenty two again i spoke she did that two-three times, after that she called me to come from my seat to the front near her. Stand with hands at back and speak again 2 -3 times, kids were laughing so she maybe got kick out of it continue. When she got bored. She sent me back t o seat. And you know 1/2/3 class kids like to joke about everything. So after the teacher made joke of me like that they got something to get laughs.

After that i begin to have trouble speaking whenever i am dealing with people in groups. One to one was okay. But whenever it came to group i faced trouble raising my voice, speaking too much or too loud because if felt so ashamed of it. Even if they don’t tease me now, in furutre when they will need something too laugh at they will probably use it, so i shouldn’t try to glow too much,

I thought that was the reason for me to lose my confidence.

After that i even devised tricks to hide my flaws like whenever we had to count or say something which was in 20-30 i would id it like this fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen after that i will stard to speak words in hindi like unnis(19) biees (20) ikis(21) bais (22) theis (23) chaubis(24).

When i grew up and was in 7th, 8th class then from there. Whenever a word came in middle of speaking, i know i will pronounce wrongly. I will instead of speaking that word. I will speak a hindi synonym of that. And my friends in many situation used to find that play of words funny.

But I remember my friend Ayush came to me and he was angry. He said i should complain about my sister to my mother. I felt so great. But i think i always lived in denial and i brushed him off saying something i don't remember words but it doesn't affect (Mujhe farak nhi padta).

I didnt understand it back then but now i realise that back then i had this false ego, social mask so my confidence was hollow even before that. I can’t trace back too much cause memory are blurry

I tried to think of reasons.

Maybe it was because in childhood we had a group of 4 friends (Ayush, me, akshat bhiya, parth bhiya). And parth bhiya was the biggest one, so unki hi chlti thi. And he had a distant attitude from me and i felt he was always biassed towards me and excluded me a lot. The reason behind it was because my little brother used to do false chugli of parth bhiya to dadaji and papa. And dadaji will then scold him. So due to relation he distanced me a lot. I guess in small age you are more sensitive to social approval, validation and when i felt excluded it left an imprint on me. My best friend ayush would tell me of things he did together with other bunch, and they never invited me to many of that, i used to complain and cry over how unfair this is that i am not getting the normal life that everyone has, i hated my brother because all of this was because of him. He used to falsely complain about me and father would beat me. I am so pitiful. Over time this frustration built up.

One day, i was playing with the group. We were having a discussion but i started to cry due to pent up frustration. I am not the one who complains to dadaji and suyash also false complains about me. I remember them all cheering me up and saying that we will teach good lessson to suyash and they did but nothing changed. Humans don’t change so easily. 

Also a second memory comes to my mind that happened at the same place as where i crien and they went over to suyash .i.e Ayush was telling akshat bhiya or parth bhiya that why he considered me his best friends. He said everyone used to make fun of him or tease him for having black skin colour but never once have I teased him about his colour.

I was overly sensitive as a child so that must be the reason, i never made fun of his colour, whenever i am trying to tease or make a joke.

It was the first compliment which  just stuck in my heart so deeply.. That's why I remember this incident which was occured about when we were in 1st 2nd class.

I guess he was insecure about his looks for a long time and he still is cuz he didn’t get a girlfriend like his friends. Actually he wanted to be a cricketer but his father died due to heart attack

In childhood earlier than 4th-5th class.

There was nalla in front of entrance ot my gully and i will think of how fun it will be to just throw my bicycle. It was not frustation but was, you know the world is so wrong and everything should burn to dust. Anger towards my parents, friends, world, existence and God itself.

There were lot of times where i will feel it will be so fun if, i was born a orphan, ibwill be free and so joyful.

If my parents were to die i would be free but i will drag myself out of my fantasies by thinking, what i am thinking is bad.

There were times i will feel that if i take a knife and pierce my heart using that but i would sometimes even grab knife play with it but i knew internally i was too coward and afraid of pain, i will never kill myself.

9th class bday was kind of okay but mom gave me just a big tiffin and asked me to share chols batura with my friends. 

I don't remebe exactly if i was happy or sad .

In 10th 11th i was sad.

In 12th class i don't want to be happy. I just want to remian sad. Maybe it's guilt over wasting time that i don't think i deseve to be happy.

I used to get an urge to see what would happen if I threw my bicycle into the sewers .

When i again felt happiness in jan/feb feb 2022 which i thought i will never be able to feeel, it felt really nice

feb- October end was no progress 2-3 chapters. I couldnt even revise the whole old chapter i have earlier dfone in this big time. How2 pathetic is that. but i wasnt happy/sad. Neutral state. I will ocasiionalyy fall into despair and feel like i im in no better position than i was in earlier. I am still as fragil e weak and pathetic

I belive from 12th jan-feb to 12th (till now 7/nov/2022) is the hardest i have worked till now. Even though all time went to waste and i don't have single thing to show for any of my effort. 

I still believe it's the hardest i have work, trying to change things. (Before 12th jan-feb it was more of an powmetless position where i didn't do anything and was just weakling crying, cowering away from reality. 

But from jan-feb i have been trying so hard to change things, to change myself, to stop suffering, to not fall into desperation, i know if i allow myself to be loose a little bit i will turn into a completely useless being that not only hurt himself but bring sorrow on those around him, just the thought of falling into that place scares me and what scares me the most how powerless i am, how no matter how much i wriggle and suffer, i can't change anything, my biological body willnt work with me even if i try to keep my spirit high, i don't think there is anything that will fulffill me, make me hsppy. Yes temporal happiness may come and go but my soul colour can't be change it has been tainted forever. the only thing that will get me out of all this suffering is  death. I truly wish i could die sooner but all these responsibilities that i have will never allow me to run away from life and kill myself.  

But here j just suffer for no good reason. I wish I have a better reason to be sad about maybe some terminal illness or injury and say that god was just unfair to me. Atleast then my sorrow will be justified but here I suffer for no good reason.

The thought scares me that k will always be strangled between two.

I wish there was a way to disappear in a way as if i never even existed.

The best i can do is try that i don't make others around me more unhappy and try to give them little more happiness. 

Even though it feels like biological body doesn't care at all.

It doesn't care about father, mother, suyash, vedant bhiya and 

I will not feel positive emotions emission even if push myself to make them happy. 

 But i will still try to not let my sadness overpower me and spread it to others.

IUt was really so painful and difficult to act like normal when example someone come home and dad will say he doesn't have friends and he doesn't care they apparently have that image of me that i didn’t care about friendships, and when he was saying that it was difficult to explain sensation but a feeling of sudden numbness, emotional will hit me and i knew if i stayed in this situation for too long, if i speak even a full sentence, my voice will be I will start to cry, it’s difficult to even act/pretend but my whole power was stripped away, cuz how should i put this, in extreme pain/anger. You have ability to talk in FriendlyTone as long as you use willPower if you don’t let emotion get the best of you.

However in emotional numbness, i can speak sentence with will power, but i just couldn’t withdraw any emotion even for pretention. The best i can do is speak few words and act like i have withdrawn in thinking about something and transition isn’t so fast that they can connect and catch on. I have to be smooth

DO WORK while TRANSPORTING yourself to these **ELYSIUMS**.
Whether it was 1min,1hr,1d,1yr,10yr,…ago 
**EVERYTHING IS HERE ALL AT ONCE** 

YOU HAVE forgotten EVERYTHING, all that made PAST so so ==damn HOLY TIME==. ==[[Xantha - Phantom Sovereign]]==.
That’s why WANTED bath in NIGHT SKY
Reason WHY as child, i felt so beyond all - cuz their world - LACKED BEAUTY & PROPORTIONS
STOP with *what gained* or *what lost*
YES, I WANT TO CONTROL PEOPLE, to prune them, replant them in GARDEN of MY CHOICE
“STRONG ENOUGH TO HAVE IT ALL, TOO WEAK TO TAKE IT”

> [!Attention] ABSOLUTELY NOW - Vedant BHIYA goals set = SOUL RECOVER

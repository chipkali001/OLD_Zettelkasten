(MAYBE DON’T TELL THEM CLASS)

Kunal bought lizard plastic.

Now i have ectreme fear of lizard and even plastic lizard scared me i didn't wanted to see the tou kuch less touch, so i kneew if i shoe weakness in front of him, he will use that to scare me.

SO I ACTED LIKE OH! CHIPKALI LAYE HO? Aacha hai.

Now he was throwing them at kids and girls and i was just on side of him, laughing with him,and saying chipkali.

Now after little time, he is going overboard comedy will complain to mam he should stop now but he was having lot of fun, he wouldn’t stop, and one reason why i wanted to go away from

CUZ I WAS BADLY SCARED OF CHIPKALI, even the lizard in his hand, i never really saw it, i was just seeing by blurring my eyes, i was that scared of toy.

BUT I CAN’T AFFORD TO GO.

Cuz if i didn’t perfectly build impression in his mind, that ‘Chipkali hoti bhi to kya’ he may throw it at me when finding the chance

NOW Normally other people and girls will scream first time then they won’t show that good reaction but now there was girl named Khushi,

shel,  was just running away and screaming a lot, so kunal too was getting his fill of dopamine but then she later told mam

‘Agrim and Kunal were trying to scare her’

Mera naam phele liya even though mene chipkali chui bhi nhi.

Mam slapped us both.

Kunal asked me to grab my tongue say 3-2

And then he said ‘ooowaoowa mam agrim is abusing’

I didn’t even understood what gali i said.

 I told mam ij ust did what he asked me but even then mam reprimanded me

We will throw it at a girl named Khushi.

It was really fun but she told mam and two of us were punished.

There was a girl ‘khushi’ in our class who was very very scared of lizard. My friend kunal bought a fake lizard to scare a girl khushi. He threw fake lizard on her watched her run. He did it multiple time. I too was standing with him so when she complained to mam the two of us had to get punishment.

ME TO SIRF OUT OF PEER PRESSURE ACT KR RHA THAA pr teacher itne zaalim hain

This reminds me of the plastic chipkali with Kunal, Kunal bought plastic chipkli and we were throwing it at girls it was really fun. But one girl complained and both of us were beaten. I thought lizard was Kunal so wohi phsega

In 8th class there was a girl named Anshu, her nose was compressed and her jaw was misaligned (so when she used to speak it was little weird sounding)

Almost all the boys in our class used to bully her. In those times, I didn't even know what the term bullying even meant and used to think of it as a completely normal thing to poke fun at classmates but with her they all exceeded the limits. 

They practised untouchability with her.

Like One time during a period I went up to pick up my copy from the teacher's desk, and when I arrived at my seat. Few of my friends started doing ‘eww’ (disgust face) and said that Anshu touched your copy and now you're touching. They will place a finger on their nose to look like her (her nose was compressed) and then will like to mimic and worse exaggerate how she speaks by noises (her jaw was misaligned).

I now regret that, Even though I felt bad. I tried talking to my friends you shouldn’t do that but i was not really proficient with my language, words and conveying myself.

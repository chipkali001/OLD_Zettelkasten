**sthory sthreeth smarth** - *learn to tell this indirectly- cuz **magic** only when it appears **without any effort***
**Distractory Story/Question/Problem to subtly input this**
**lack common sense people? Why? Explain**
**I had lots in childhood but ,forgotten now. 
Let's talk Vikas**
*Vikas* - left without telling, not inform about going to somewhere. Go back after once knock even though I told to wait.
Before even leaving not tell, **and he'd  like I don't know what I will do without you - koi aur mere liye itni help nhi karta, you have helped me lot, saath mein ghumenge exam kee baad**
*he was simple honest guy not like me who will try to use clever tricks*(tell implicitly you using clever trick by telling that if you felt irritated- be like - oh go to college together you too go work hardz we have less time.)


Me
- not eat chola batura.
**behaviour** - do you know why happen. See crowd not eat.
Like chola batura remember.
It's tasty good, very less stuffin mess I will call good but it was really good. But he after seeing crowd went **i'm not eating.** You are lucky **it's skill**




**Dream**
Govt make dinosaurs/dragon/monster liel creature to destroy.
In beginning a man gets destroyed for speaking out.
**there was a girl who was lowers sort in drram**
Suprise me know 2-3 language
She claimed know Tamil, (a lot fo South Indian language ihave forgotten name),hindi
**On first explosion I jump from building, knew no time to get off normally (idk how survive)**
But somehow maybe car protects or the area u was in.
There i see finosaur
And girl words of her telling me of govt doing this rings.
She had idk proof/futuristic-device I don't remember but it is powerful and also exposes govt 
I also remember there was man mahbe he was close with me kr we had mutual respect but i does something that betrays value and he is after me(I learn through omniscient perspective )
I run back  hotel where girl was in hastily to inform
See bunch of people taking elevator.
(Thought maybe that man send them here for me)
I take stairs her room at very top. But when I arrive at very top
It was super luxurious room. I didn't understand it was super maze like.
At first I thought maybe one door leads to corridor but couldn't find.
(Before this I went their with aelevator always.) Was this place there on top floor confusion con.
I run randomly until an man dinds me (considers me theif, points maybe gun at me I don't remember, or maybe call authorities, he was running away from govt too I tell him to please listen to me, he aaya if it were an ordinary person would have believe me, I again beg and try to explain
**in end he gets it**
And previous elevator crowd came to arrest him
I ask him to join me.
He tells govt is already few steps of ahead of me. He can't join me (won't be good fo us.)
I get out make my way.
I have to just now walk straight end of corridor her room.
Sees bunch of people shooting at that man's door. I run from behind peerskn, push him, manage to grab his **shot**gun, fires the same gubbat him, keep the gun then snatch another gun from man just next and take him as hostage. 
People from down point shotgun at me. But I had meatshield. Then a person comes from front side. Points gun fire. It was an ice type gun that freedrs. He thought I have been frozen but i used other gun to create illusion in frozen.
The illusion cracks and he notice bis the one who has been frozen

Fights way greater than 10 times
Cuz how did I devlop strategy of kick
1) fact one pretend to punch, stable difficult and can't give off I am going to kick
2) **tell this by clean vs dirty** my kick wasn't momentum, it was there leg stepping forward and I will just move little. It was almost like me stepping on knee and pain even if I had close to zero momentum if it hit knee pain to severe and will sit holding, neck exposes and even if pain not enough to make them sit and hold left, they are shocked so I will grapple little while holding legs, beating on back until their knees cave in
**Bam** - knee hit, leg hit rest other in air 
**clean was in- knee resting or direct knee hit (moving or not)**
**Dirty** - below knee hit moving or unmoving

Have you bees?
- stanford, bees cover the whole sky, epic scene, teacher asked to lie on ground, after some time get up and run while crouching
- cricket break, dm-house(ias) abandoned building guards there. Building was used for office party during one of parties I sneaked in and open one of door which can be only locked from inside (,don't say kundi/it makes it sound less smart) and shifted things around such that normal person think it's close. Me chupan chupai mein cheating krkne ke liye use krta tha, to mere aalwa kisi ko pata nhi tha. Pr i showed and we used that door that day

**alright faith not loose. Sir May or May not loose value me but atleast ambiguity is still better  **


Okay now
Sir don't know Hindi
Shubhankar unaware of situation
Kartikey too shocked or **most likely** *me pulling him in crime* think shubhankar will enjoy him get beaten
*Now I don't remember what i said exactly*
First thing was sir-enhlish me-hindi i just spoke anything incompreshible I knew sir willnt understand a thing I will say nor did I what is
But talk has shifted now to me complaing of kartikey 
That disturbs in sirs period and other period. Follows us whereever we sit.
Meri tone bhot serious aur assertive type mein bola.
Yee bolke Mee aapni seat ses aapna paair nikal kr nikla.
Apni priy mitr ko uthane ke liye.
While I was pulling my leg 
My mind was like fuck fuck (i messed up, me turning from sharmana to serious assertive isn't natural, sir will catch me changing topic without changing it)
**next thing j remember I am laughing and sir beat**
Baki class ke teacher circle surrounds 
**me muuh niche krke hasi rook rha hun, wo dono lall muuh kee saath khade hai**
Koi shrm nhi hai, kitne besharam hain



Sampatii jaydad







Uffff yaar
Kya maja de Rahi hai tumhari --- ki gaand



***shubhankar was good person, very cheerful, happy, excited***
I will be breaking my values by betraying someone this purity. 

Ab sir see to nhi puch skta ki
Aapko kya lgta hain hm kya baate kr rhe thee.
**I cant do that**
Next best thing in lying js something vague jisse unke intution ko kisi predictionki situation kya hai uspe aane pee help hon. 
**sir asked me to be specific and tell**
He wasn't in mood of predicting he was angry and wanted direct answer. 
I knew **I willnt break my values to kuch *jugaad* try krte hain**

Shubhankar lacks situation awareness, so his understanding will shift probably to situation is me complaining of kartikey now with anger.
And he doesn't need to speak anything really cuz you know if abc suddenly gets super angry out of sudden at abc then you will stay quiet.

Storing emotions 


Kartikey said understood my tricks pointed to 
- shubhankar and hkm fight
But was amazing too some area not paranoid stupid
- raising my voice to win argument. He pointed when I used it instrumentally laryiall not natural manner(he felt I did ) 
-

A women should know how to take orders

In between say it's break but a reply lot of things were going in my head but problem was
1) shubhankar willnt like me getting out unscathed. I have broken **frendship value** and another previous incident happened where he told me ki **me chalaki krta hun (with kartikey)**
2) kartikey and shubhankar both join in tell sir & loose reputation in his eyes

Probelm
Time not choose
1) Sir 50% chance beat kartikey
Subhankar 40% ask (idk why kartikey didn't asked but most likely it's either -too much shocked & off gaurd catch -he said I turned his friends into enemy to hm dono enjoy krenge usko pitta dekh kr)
**10% chance beat both** (*i want*)
2) If spoke kartikey beat


**Before he betrays me, I can do it.**





Kartikey said tum bhot **arrogant hon** aur chalaki krte hon?

Class bhot enviornment thi, sb maar kha lenge pr koi kisi kaa naam nhi lega.
To meri first instinct thi ki wo nhi bolne wali, pr pr jb mei gya aur mene socha to situation jb teacher  aachanak see kuch puche aur koi jawab na de vs jha pr blackmail phele kosis ki hon, aur agla period English ka tha to wo daar wala component bhi.
Oh fuck wo sayad mujhe bhi fasnane ki koshis kre



**my total thing made me cower otherwise I wouldn't have problem putting blame**
Mam ne mujhe bola lane ko
To mujhe end mein bs feel hua ki
Abhi mein bag lene Jaa rha hun ya pehele chale jata end main fdk kya padta. I was afraid of how to explain me phele bhi kisi ke puchne pr koi bhi unhe premise de skta tha.
Kya hua?
Bcho me bag feek dikya
Mein to mein uthane aaya tha
I can easily put myself in ang position. Somya ne giraya tha 




All my friends clinging to door screaming , banging the door 
And they were pushing each other 
Monkey is sitting on top of takhat still.
I go around in manner that I am on 180* to monkey vision.
Monkey is looking at door.
And i instinctively swing my hand at face level
(There is no thinking. Its mor eof fight and flight situation. Body is acting on instincts)

Tum chalaki krte hon?
Mujhe thoda bura lga
Mene reflect Kiya aur sayad  maybe I have been self-centered aur selfish ways mein act kr rha hun 
Cuz due to circumstances and situations I had very serious rigid aur any person/dost sbse mein ek level pr single-minded emotionally disconnected & didn't valued. 
To maybe I should atleast try to be little warm.

Next day?
I understand all your tricks 
I can read your mind

Now now
Before this I was in icse board Christian school and it was super mega strict.
Even in that small age 5-8yrs( in which j was there) beat kids with stick leave mark on back.
Everything was super regimented, itna Sara syllabus, rattna,
Me bhi hyper hardworking sincere
**no games period**
**I was also super serious child**
*that used to be my world one time*
So me being in that position now just watching from above.
Top floor air blow nice, lying on bench staring out
*I wanted to go to school everyday*
My other friends like rudra and others didn't enjoyed it to same extent ever cuz rudra just didn't go for comfort.




Long line. (Saturday special meal so super Crowdy & we arrived at time too when it's most Crowdy normally)
**Bad about it -** wait for long, good seat may get taken cuz too much crowd or no seat at all.
**do** - take plate empty, you can break line for just picking it up from above their heads,
Go to last corner where there is no crowd and paratha in casrol. 
**seat secured for now**
*can wait for line to pass or or
Rule of going in line is for first time takers, as long as I am going there again with half eaten food, I can just take stuff by interjecting line.*
Can ask kid next to me to secure seat while I go






Dont say divide and rule (it will simplify the process in their mind)
Instead desecribe in 
1) first word- poaching 
2) go and make them against each other, while being their friend, when they will insult each other, i will give them facial reactions and comments that will make them fight more

Rudra super chalu
Rudra push blame on me. 
All I had to do was act playful " xyz period mei koi baat kr rha tha ki abc " 
Aur phir uski direction mei dekhte rhe 

Physics Lavi sir 9th class parents name


Me bol rha tha
Mujhe abhi aawaz aayi thi sayad....
(I'm for first time feeling weird thing that I should cut out part **mera paathar**)
!midsentence my sentence changed to )
Mujhe abhi aawaz aayi thi sayad.. ayush tumhara pathar car pr lg gya 
**instantly i was how can I do that to my friend cuz it happened so in split second**
*Akshat bhiya had abrasive personality so I knew he will push him without hesitation*
6yr old (cuz 7yr old on trip) not very good at separating emotions from actions 

I'm really intrigued


1. Begining don't tell not want kartikey and shubhankar coliation just tell want to spread out blame so no phone calls atleast. I can manage ptm somewhow. 
2. He got beaten cuz of me so I will have to take same responsibility. (Dont use word hurt him but take responsibility )
3. Now at this point I can't say anything which will get two of us beaten. Only he will recieve sirs wrath
4. Now **second problem has arisen cuz of that** kartikey getting beaten now seem inevitable and probelm is that what will happen next shubhankar got beaten & he too & I am unscathed laughing. 
5. They'll go tell sir & what was my premise "piche see dono hasa rhe thee" if shubhankar is there my premise crumbles The trust and faith sir putted on me will break too 
7. **it's all preventable, if I betray my values, and sacrifice subhankar** it is very easy. Before they **even go up** just in **front of them**, go to sir and sir please change my seat and ask subhankar and kartikey to not bother me. **after that they can say anything but it willnt matter**
8.  Another problem if I don't act now there is subhankar lying on ground. Kartikey can use him to testify against me. However he hasn't done till now cuz everything was happening really fast. The amount of explanation and how I am trying to explain all doesn't cover pace & he was caught too off-guard. I can prevent kartikey from doing that by now going to him and shaking him and asking *abhi piche see hmme yee dono hasa rhe thee piche see* now shbhandidny have that much awareness of what talk was going on or anything cuz sir just beat him down so bad and if I am emotionally charge enough it willnt matter. 




Delhi ncr



Gagan bhiva drove me to - for competition and stuff.
Cuz we were from UP. And school and all that happened in haryana 




I will summarise whole thing is complex and I don't even have memories. I can very vaguely recall and see progression.
- New school strict, beginning bored didn't enjoy, 
- found my mind kartikey and shubhankar 
- now I have been game-makine-programming, maths, art, stuff. Do lot of stuff & hobbies & ambitious. So many things I want to do.
- I was able to ignite interest in kartikey.
- from life of kartikey and shubhankar just normally living school Jana, hasna, khelna, aana
- 






Tell them you have nkw forgotten lot of memories 
(Use that too show you have extra complexity)


After telling shubhankar kartik of alok sir call mom dad
Be happy and then let me tell you what happened jb assembly.
Mam said ""
Mom said "she said the exact opposite "
I told sir school bhi nhi aate unhe kuch bhi kaisa PTA hoga. 


Lack values and principles 

When shubhankar not kartikey get up comes tell.
I am narrating slowly and explaining this was reason that was reason behind that and all that things but everything happening really fast 
Kartikey from bfjng falsely blamed to be shut in between speaking.







**after befriending rudra**
*Without him my life would have been very dull*
Rudra cuz RT
No assembly go
Koi **day** hai to bcho ko Jamin pr dhup mei baitha rkha hai, aur hm bs aaram see class mei baith skte hain, aur aaisa nhi hai ki jaise Jo bche bunk marke unhe teachers see chupna pdta hai, hm koi tension nhi koi kuch bol nhi skta 
***canteen see kuch Lee aau aur Shanti see upar see dekho ***

Till class4th I was in super strict ICSE school and now transition to this? 

**he was super chalu and still had some seeds of hatred against me. most times when get caught rudra he will try to push blame on me**
I also knew mei kis janwar kee saath hun. 
Toi mei uski alligenation pr serious express nhi show krta tha, bs smile krunga ki, koi 4th period mei baat krrha tha ki "aur phir wo hasne lg jayga"
**aur like situation hoti thi, ki hm 3-4 Longo ka group hai, teacher puchega ki kya kr rhe thee, to wo mujhe aage push krega ki explain kro**
Mei bhi just aage jaunga aaram see, teacher question phir see puchega, aur teacher ke paas jaage mudkr uske chahre pr dekhunga
Teachers usse jante ho thee, to.....
**Problem bs unke saamne hoti thi Jo mujhe jaante thee**
Jaise ek baar Haan class mei thee 11-12yrs, bche khi gye honge saare. Hm

Sahi hai

Casually pass by gagan bhiya comment don't make it look important.
Dont show that you actively wanted them to loose it's weak! Say that you messaged enemy DONE! No you don't care you were just seeing stuff unfold



Bandar on vertical takhat
Almost feels like you can just push.
I think my body fight aur flight mei thi to natural fighting instinct
(I don't understand myself)
of attacking weak part of enemy take over probably 
And it all happened refelx action.
But I moved in way I have to protect my face .

4. School hamara main city see duur, bhot hariyali Wale region mei tha to bs wha upar see leet kr tum curtain kee Kone see bahar kaa najara dekh skte hon
5. Pr kyuki wo itna dur tha to internet ka signal nhi aata, to ham niche administrator office tha, wha pr humne robotics/programming ka bahana lekar unse wifi connect karwaya pr unhone hme bola ki abhi kaam krke fprgot karwake Jana. To phone mei wo options hota hain na ke QR-Code scan krke tum wifi access dusre phone me le skte hon agar ek mei logon hain
6. Also main competition over home ke baad, ek aur unhone scheme start ki thi ki tum direct national finals mei entry le skte hon. (Yee jio era start hue bhot km time hua tha, to internet ki taraf ) Uske liye ek video unke website PR upload krnk thi aur wha see likes jinke sbse Jayda honge (you have to make account on website first then only like) so beginning mei Jo likes bakiyo ke pe the who the 20-25 the per mene Temp mail use krke 200tk apne pohchadiye.
7.  Kuch time baad mene baki Jo *senior level league* (12vi) ke bache thee unke usme ek team thi jiske bhot high likes thee (I was 13y old, 12-14 saal ke bcho), to mene unko bhi batadiya, to unhone kuch dino mei upar hogye
8. Pr kuch time baad meri unse ladayi hogi, to mene Jo dusri team thi Jo phele do team top pr thi rhi thi unhe mail krke bataya ki, unke opponent kj team ke surge of likes ka kya reason hai, aur official website Walo ko bhi bata Diya ki aap ki site pr yee scan ho rha hain, aur baki bhi mei jitni teams ko inform kar skta tha mene inform kr diya. To bs ek hi raat mein  do  opponent team ne hmare school Wale team ko piche krdiya

12. Jo hmare robot ko task krna tha mujhe uske liye ek section ko program krne ke liye arena ke exact measurements, ya colour sensor chahiye tha kyu Jo mere paas infrared sensor tha wo limited tha, Bina us arena ko print karaye possible nhi hain. (Colour sensor mehnga tha me nhi khridne wala)
13.  To mene unhe jakar pucha ki yee wala part kaise hoga
14. To wo shocked the ki mene kha see programming Sikh Li yha school mein to sikhayi nhi
15. unhone programming 5k-10k (paanch da haazar)paise dekar, wo he Friday ko gurgaon 50-60km car see drive krna aana Jana krkr ke kuch krke sikhi thi. Unhone kuch months lge 
16. programming software mein 3 sensors the to un sensor ke input ko kaise Lena hai  uske sample program the , like you know jaise tum me tumhe three device joystick, mouse, keyboard ke kaise input ko programming mein us krna hain uske example, to wo hi read krke mujhe common sense lagayo to baki sb kuch bhi automatically sense banane lgega. 
18. Twp bhi same conclusion pe aaye ya to colour sensor khrido ya o usme unhone help Kiya, unhone jin teacher see programming sikhi thi wo teacher dps mein bhi sikhate thee, to unhone unki programming hmare Wale robot ke li thi

Realisation and implication of what is happening was shocking Unconscious processing.

Realise in mid air, then began to fall/

Jpm story don't say mom misunderstand tell
I maybe at low power position but who are they to stop me 
I can't do it directly now
So I will have to use covert means. 



Lizard dear why? Before even 6-7
1. When I was small while playing
2. Two fighting chipkali fell on me many times
3.  While opening door falling on me
4. Waking up and finding chipkali on my chest
5. **after those incidents more dremas**
6. Walking in house full of Lizard can fall anytime
7. Swarm of chipklais falling and getting inside my clothes (actually I fought a Lizard man and after getting defeated by hin)
8. **it wasn't all bad, almost missed getting bitten by snake, I am so disconnected from reality in my thoughts, thing j am doing , but chipklai fear made me check even better than my mom can**
This happened when I was 5-6-7 so it was impression leaving 



A time 






Apoorv was enigmatic person.
I don't think I really knew him, even though we sta together for few months.
He knew more about me than i about him. Maybe I was too self absorbed to ask right question and never ailled it. 



 Note pressure really feel due to disconnect and thinking later improvement anyway why does it matter anyway.
 I can do it later anyway.

*it was from anger to helplessness*
Mujhe almost ronne jaisa feel ho rha thaa yee dekhar.
I discovered that and i am not planning to share it with anyone.
Sir bought kulhadi, kids made space.
Moment it dig and pull out. 
Everything is still ingraned, it almost felt like everything
How the sand grains felt off the edges of kulhadi.
Kulhadi still in mid air in instant everyone 20&25 jumped on the he kulhadi itself trying to steal.
I too jumped ot was so chaotic i don't remember exactly how things happened but I managed to snatch and held it in fetal position they were trying to scratch, beat, kick anything to take it but I just stayed ther e like stone 







Ummid nhi ki thi?
Bbola fha ki wo to introverted him wo aaise nhi kr skta

**Fe made me adjust andk
I was just a prop. They like prop more. Like they'll say you're addicted addiction laugh at my hobbies.
And most likely why I didn't share anything -ve, cause they always made fun of my emotions, you cry too much. 
In rudra one, they didn't side instead shamed me, it hurted more, cause that is my Fe pers 

**vedant bhiya small visits here were the one that gave me lot of GROUNDIN, ANCHORING & STRENGTH**


In an instant i felt just a tug and i couldn't speak 
I just stopped.
(Don't tell flashback here it will )
They were looking at me.
Ayush, sayad tumhara...
**now I wasn't type of kid who lie, i was really honest, upright kid, it was part of my idenity at that age and took pride in , not to lie, to help others.**
*I couldn't imagine how i can say that?* it may look insignificant from your perspective 
I was so shocked that i can still recall exact line of something I said when I was 6years
**guilt came so does reason ns**
and memories of time when I expected that they are my friends theyll hide and protect me and not tell mom, but they did.
**i only said sayad**



I had crazy zombie dream. I was back in a school building. Close to place drink water, we were joking around with Pooja mam.
Then I hat i saw could only be described by breathtaking. 
It was dawny enviornment so what i saw was an huge architect piece being propelled up into air super high, falling and demolishing building.
Scene out of movie or godzilla
Behind were giant sized zombie-titans. 
I first dashed to travel to top of building to find people above already infected so started going down.
There was persoon sorts who took me & one kid along in car and soon joined by another kid (who was weird, mentally-different)
He drove car godly fast.
We asked to slow down or we may have accident. We will have to pickup fuel and spare cars. 
Soon we saw an zombie accident next to us and we were like go fast. 
Then we(they all) went near to an army base and we saw missiles flying off.
(Only j saw vision of an weird creature landing, opening eyes attacking and guns not working since he was dad, nothing inside helmet )
Then my parents came and their mom &her maid came together.

Giant monster battling it was perhaps a dragon vs skeleton monster type. 
(Just grand )
Whole city buring being captured by demons.

It saadens me seeing how not interacting doens't affect me. The difference then vs now.
I am so so so disconnected.
But i have Ni so it can't break me. My reality was always seprate and willbe always 


Forgetting how to laugh and enjoy with others. & Again learning it.
It was so shocking

What even changes between me going now and hoing earlier.
Nothing has changed?

I can guide them to have any understanding of situation?

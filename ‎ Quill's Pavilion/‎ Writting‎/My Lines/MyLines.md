Before i knew it i was humming,
As if i was trying to muffle cries of my heart by sound of my voice.

Weren't you the one who lead the siege?

I know this arrangement was sudden for Both of us. We couldn't meet normally and fall in love but not for a single moment i will let you feel our love is any less. 
I will make sure even your friends will feel envious of your happiness.

# TREXIA SYSTEM
Realms exist inside a world
Worlds exist inside a plane
Planes exist inside THE VOID/CHAOS

Strong Entity Can Create their own world and set rules for world. 
Where does the souls go?
They can create Underworld Realms & Paradise Realms  if they want
They can make them eternal living if they want.
THE REASON WHY THEIR SOUL DON’T DEGRADE AND GO TO LOWER REALM AFTER DEATH IS BECAUSE They aren’t dying really it’s an artificial world. 
AND YOU WILL NEED ENOUGH STRENGTH TO FRACTURE HOLE IN THE WORLD to REALLY REALLY KILL SOMEONE SO EVEN IF THEY DIE IN THAT REALM they fall down.
And that’s why AETHER can move souls cause it’s only limited to ARTIFICAL WORLD.
AETHER IS NOTHING OUTSIDE THAT WORLD


# SEVEN PLANES

 2. Mortal Plane - Place where all elements intermix, where ordinary humans and mortal creatures reside.
 3. … Realm - This is the highest plane, reserved for the …. deities or ancient beings that existed 
 4. Spiritual Plane - This realm is often depicted as a transitional space between the mortal and immortal realms. It is populated by spirits, ghosts, and other supernatural beings, and may be accessible only to those who have cultivated their spiritual energy or psychic powers.
 5. Immortal Plane - This is a higher plane where immortal beings reside. Immortals are often depicted as having near-limitless life spans, incredible strength, and magical powers. In some stories, this realm may be further divided into sub-realms or sects, each with their own distinct culture and hierarchy.
 6. Celestial Plane - This is a plane where celestial beings such as angels, devas, or other divine servants reside. This realm is often depicted as a place of great beauty and light, and may be accessible only to those who have been granted access through acts of piety or virtue.
 7. Divine Plane - This is a plane where gods and other divine beings reside. The beings that reside in the Divine Realm are often depicted as having nearly godlike powers, and may be worshiped by mortals and immortals alike.


# REALMS OF Underworld

 1. Tartarus Realm - This is the deepest  plane of the underworld, reserved for the punishment of the most heinous of criminals and sinners. It is a place of torment and suffering, where the condemned are subjected to eternal imprisonment or brutal tortures.
 2. Erebos Realm- This is the middle plane of the underworld, a dark and shadowy realm where the spirits of the dead reside. It is often depicted as a place of judgment, where souls are weighed and either rewarded or punished based on their deeds in life.
 3. Asphodel Realm - This is the shallowest plane of the underworld, where ordinary souls go after death. It is a neutral realm, neither a place of punishment nor reward, but rather a place of quiet reflection and rest.

1.  Netherrealm - This is the deepest and darkest plane of the underworld, a place of eternal night where the spirits of the damned are consigned. It is said that the very air of the Netherrealm is thick with the screams of the tortured and the restless dead.
2.  Stygian Depths - This is the middle plane of the underworld, a twisting labyrinth of caverns and tunnels that stretch endlessly downward. It is said that the souls who find themselves trapped here must navigate its maze-like corridors for all eternity.
3.  Shadowlands - This is the highest plane of the underworld, a realm of shifting shadows and whispered secrets. It is said that those who find themselves in the Shadowlands must constantly be on guard, for the darkness can hide all manner of dangers and deceptions.

# VOID
 Void/Chaos Plane - This is a plane of emptiness, darkness, and chaos. It is often depicted as a space of great danger and unpredictability, where powerful demons and other malevolent entities reside.

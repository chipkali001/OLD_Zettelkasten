MAKE LESS SADDER VERSION TOO
Desire Wanted - Phone

**TO MAKE IMPACT OF TRADEGY STICK** (I was impatient, i can’t just wait 5-6 yrs without doing anything about it)
first describe effort
- Check if mom isn’t watcihng me escape
- i will have to go in hiding in noon when no stone maison
Roof was problem
- Solved by using jalli of of cooler 
Asked for idols
Mene khud ke paise kuch rkh diye (taki bakiyo ko raah dikh sake kya krna hain)
- Mom refused
So i draw them myself - **COLOUR KIYA** 
> [!Attention] SHAAM i will have to wait (While at it make lil melancolic expample )
- Now it wasn’t like i didn’t knew I VERY WELL what will be the result of making mandir but i really wanted phone, 
- My mummy/papa said 8000rs but i will just go to them say 8000paise 
- i will repeat 8000paise until they are like 8000paise & 100paise=1rs 
> [!Attention] this is nice was of telling 100paise=1rs BEGIN by DIALOGUES instead of an monologue or explanation
- Mene actually calculate kiya thaa ki mujhe 8000rs and result that ki 5-6ys
- Mandir or Bhagwan meri aakhri ummid th
- **Aur mein jb bahar gya to chamdkar hogya -    GUESS KRO?**

**MANDIR DONE**
I told all my friends about my plan
This amount of people pass through here everyday
If x% pass by here and leave 1-2rs then
How much time for me to BUY my own phone

*US SHAAM KO NHI JAA PAYA MEIN WAHA* aur agle bhi pure din nhi dekh paya 
i don’t remember kya reason that but it was what happened.
Now evening arrived.
I was excited to see results.
But my mom was making me do homework so jb tk mei n pohcha bahar to thoda auur shyaam ho gyi thi.
But it’s an GOOD FEELING when you FINISH ALL YOUR WORK, Now I CAN ENJOY.

i went outside- my friends were playing cricket **==NEXT TO THE TREE under which my temple==**

==SMILE MAKE THEM ANTICIPATE WHAT HAPPENED?== - make it feel as though they stole money  or some that type of stuff

- LAUGH WHILE  SAYING THIS
Unhone bola kutte ne kiya hain


NOW tell them 
- mood ruined, i wasn’t interested in playing 
- I went home 
- Made It Again & Now self lie part - I EARLIER CALCULATED- my income 1 or 2rs everyday. it will take god knows how many years for me to buy 6k-7k phone. I lied to myself 1rs=100paise phoene is 6000paise - **i knew super super very well i was lying** - but i made everyone agree to my lie

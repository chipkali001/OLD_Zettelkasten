Methods and maneuvers can vary endlessly, but they all have two
things in common: They are both indirect and ineffective, and they include pretending to bump into women, asking to light their cigarettes, joining dance classes, asking for directions, dressing outrageously to get attention, asking friends for introductions, forming strong friend-ships with women first, passing notes in class, offering to buy drinks, and buying a cute puppy hoping it will run up to a woman or draw her attention. 
It seems as if males will try anything other than walking up to women all by themselves and talking to them without hiding their intentions as if **women were highly *dangerous* or *uninterested* in men.**

# Semantics of books
Men=10% male | Women=10% female
"the majority of females want." is very different from a statement such as the majority of women want"   

# Attraction is deeper than logic -SOMETHING WITH REPTILIAN BRAIN
## 1. Women don’t see beauty as men
### Beauty
Why male choose
1) healthy 
2) old enough to be sexually mature 
3) yet still young so they lived long enough to give birth and raise their offspring.
This is why physical signs of health, sexual maturity, and youth are all ports of the concept of beauty, 
##### Reason BIOLOGICALLY all for baby’s health
#### Males assumes automatically females same 
For males, being beautiful is of little importance because babies do
not grow inside their bodies. They cannot give birth or produce the
milk that infants need; only females can
### That’s why 5’3 with 3 or Ugly with far Beau female common
#### During pregnancy heightened cautiousness for the sake of the baby's health
females have become attracted to males who appear less vulnerable than they are, males who seem able to protect and support them better than females could on their own-males who are masculine.

### Most males erroneously assume that females have the same list
of visual qualities they do, despite seeing many couples that contradict
it, including obviously ugly or fat males with gorgeous and fit females
## 1e. The evidence is right there if you only look for it, but as most males
are unaware that females are attracted to other qualities, and since
people tend to see what they want to see, their approach causes them
**to overlook reality.**

## 2. Most of the traits that females are in fact attracted to exist more internally than externally, and they are in fact and hard to explain, such as 
- attitude, 
- behavior 
- how comfortable a male can make a female feel
> [!Note] 
> in contrast to body proportions, height, and penis size (to name only a few things that males are always worried about and that researchers in this field tend to focus on as well)

That females are **not** ***primarily*** **attracted** to **physical qualities** in males also means they cannot assign males to the same kinds of categories that males assign to females **(e.g., height)** 
- many fem insist on doing this but surprised when drawn, intrigued, confused, surprised 
**WHEN drawn to a man who does not fit their predetermined visual category**

### What it means to be a MAN 
To be a man is often more about avoiding how women walk and talk rather than actually doing traditionally manly things. 
becoming **aware of how women behave**, what typical feminine
behavior is, and **how to *avoid* it or even to do the *complete* opposite.**
Typical feminine behavior includes expressions of this vulnerability, primarily to be emotional-to show emotions of weakness or to allow yourself to be led by such emotions

The idea that females are more vulnerable than males is not a social construct but a biological fact. As a result of this, any male who appears vulnerable will thus be unattractive to females-as he will be feminine.
**women are not attracted to males who either show weak emotion or allow themselves to be led by such emotions.**

They have no confidence in taking the risks that are necessary both to be masculine and to seduce women. While being emotional and indirect are expressions of femininity, being confident and direct are expressions of masculinity. Just as you cannot be both direct and indirect at the same time, you cannot be confident (not turning back on initiatives/descisions due to mood) and emotional at the same time.


## 3. Male - Disposable Gender 
Why? 100 female can re-populate island faster than 100 male.
Female need more care, nurture.

Achieve something great, and then you can have the woman you want (movie’s story end, mc gets girl not interested in him earlier, ads, media. To succeed is to become sexy and good  enough for a woman. Success equals sex)

**INSTILL** in you the very same belief, that without doing something incredible, **you do not deserve women** and that you **do have to deserve them**. 

implications, such as, "getting lucky," "that girl is out of your league," "you do not deserve her," "win her heart," and "losers do not get laid."

The male should feel lucky 
(1) as if the female did him a favor by giving him 
(2) as if he really was unworthy of her 
(3) that his own actions had nothing to do with getting it. It was just luck!

"losers do not get laid." This implies that winners do get laid and that it is impossible to get girls if you fail in sports, school, or your career

males learn not only to pursue females like trophies, but also that they are less valuable than women since they have to work to pursue women and prove themselves to them. Even if they do not believe it, they will still act like it if they adopt such behavior.

> I allowed society and external people to control me & the reason why i hated culture here about wahmen was
> I HAVE MORE WORTH AND VALUE even than the PRETTIEST of girls
> Combo of Real-God-Lvl-Intelligence, Creativity, Self-Awareness that goes far far beyond common masses, STRONG SENSE OF WILL & DUTY (not lazy and complaining), one who have conquered and came over so so many negative forces that would have devoured anyone whole, 
> **SENSTIVITY & FEMININE ENERGY** along with **Godly Competitiveness & HARDWORKING NATURE**
> **COURAGE, the one who stands even if body too refuses to cooperate**
> Not even any person on discord
> **Someone who climbed out of hell alonoe with no support and still is GROWING STRONGER**

**you "have" self-esteem-by deciding to act as important as you really are, you will appear certain too. In this regard, self-esteem leads to confidence**


> [!Question] Why did at JPM you tried not to stand next to not make them feel uncomfortable and got pointed by ABC 
> 
> What has lead you to belief that dumb countryside girls & males have any more value more than your existence

> [!Example] 
> You don't want/expect woment to like things or do things, they don't like or are comfortable with - just to match vibes

**how much worse females are allowed to talk about and treat males as rooted in the underlying biological fact that one sex is more vulnerable than the other, while at the same time being more valuable and hence more important to society**
Manifestation- Peoples rxn of women slapping man VS man slapping women

You should be **less concerned** with what the majority of females want because you are honestly not attracted to them, and their ***opinions*** **do not represent** those **of the women you really want**
# The biggest effect that this traditional socialization has on males, however, is that it ***causes them to be indirect*** with women,
which is why almost all males try using an excuse to start up a conversation: a lighter, a dog, a friend, offering drinks, pretending to be lost, or pretending not to know what time it is. 
**This is a natural consequence for a male who believes that females do not want sex or that females are more valuable and thus have to be earned.**

<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 

##  The Point is - “male should treat a female he wants like a woman”
Make her feel feminine
Protect Her
Shield her from discomfort
**NEVER AT COST OF SACRIFICING THEMSELVES - cuz only society wants that not women**

## Female Advice - Useless and Counter-Productive (ignorant, unaware, delusional)
The best approach to get girls is to understand that **women actually are easy** while at the same time never letting them feel

## 
Females are naturally attracted to a male who believes he is important and **valuable**, but also **equal to them**, and therefore treats his female as important and valuable too.
Society want men to behave as if there are disposable and insignificant.


# Unfortunately, the more indirect a male is, the more feminine he appears, making him less attractive to women
The best way to get girls is actually not to
play the game or to think outside the box; it is to avoid playing games
and to step outside the box completely. it involves changing your
mindset from being indirect with women to being direct, from being
feminine to being masculine
**The big problem is that when males believe they are not good
('enough as they are, they chase success and money, and their masculine confidence vanishes**


Women want men who treat them like women, males who are masculine and who make females feel feminine-
**men with confidence,  charm, and responsibility.**

# Dominance is requisite for confidence
women do not care why men are confident. They only  
care about the extremely appearance of certainty.
It doesn’t matter if you are assured inside, if your appearance doesn’t say so. They aren’t attractive 
**Others may have no idea what they are doing or have misunderstood their situation entirely**, yet they appear dead certain because they act dead certain, so we label them as confident.
(Easier way to comprehen - attractive women, youthful, look will be good mother even if can’t have children is better than ugly & old)
### to be a dominant male automatically means to treat women as submissive and expect them to be submissive. This is inevitable. If you do not do so, you will act submissively yourself, and this behavior is doomed to fail with women since it is feminine.
Happened with Sumo/Moon others. 
Didn’t happened with Piu. You didn’t let age take away from your dominance.
### Point isn’t control, PUT YOUR OWN INTEREST FIRST (this is what i want) , BEING SELFISH

## take matters into their own hands and protect their own interests because no one else will do it for them

## **SELFISH**-  You are the most important person in your rife, so you should treat yourself as such, but few people do. Most are afraid of being seen as selfish and being labeled by their peers
why you hear females talk about men and their big egos, as a male who deems himself equal to females may appear that way.


those who do not trust themselves more than others tend to **rely on other people's opinion** and **to gauge** their **own worth** and importance by **how well other people regard them,** and they then act accordingly. 
This is an **easy mistake** to make since w**e are raised to seek approval** from other people. 

> [!Summary] It is not the status per se that females are attracted to in these males, but the masculine confidence apparent from their dominance
>Does not actually have to be important
to society to be attractive to women; there is no need to achieve high status,
BEHAVE LIKE YOU WILL IN FRONT OF YOUR KIDS

> [!Summary] More confidence than she does-a dominant male-a man she can look up to, and she will pay close attention to how a male behaves to judge his value.

Nevertheless, deeming yourself as the most important per_ son, including more important than the women
( No need to disrespect them ) / (just treat yourself better - DON’T APOLOGISE or EXPLAIN YOURSELF )

# End’s in the beginning
### Once you have achieved XYZ you wish to be treated ABC way. 
### JUST IMPOSE YOUR SELF-IMAGE , AUTHORITY, SELF-RESPECT  use it DOMINATE 
Reasons
1) Time too long
2) Not GARGANTUM effect you HOPED
3) Fragile (someone better than you appear, job kick, fight)
4) Doesn’t always translate well into your interaction with wahmen
5) Unnecessary (attracted to your extremely appearance-your dominance.)
Attaching your self-esteem to anything extremely is just a bad idea, unnecessary intermediary


new, then you have to understand that these feelings are learned and not natural. Just look at the way kids run around buck naked or in funny costumes, with paint and mud all over their faces, completely unaffected by their appearance. They are still smiling and playing with their friends without any worries about what other people think about them . The idea does not even cross their minds that they look ridiculous until they grow up and their parents start telling them that they must not walk outside looking like that, that they will embarrass themselves or the rest of the family, etc. children are conditioned to start
worrying about **how they look and to regard other people's opinion more than their own**
## the idea that your self-worth is open for reevaluation depending on how useful and important you are to other people-how useful you are to society
> [!Attention] learn not to rely on anyone's opinion but your own
> Doesn’t mean stop improving.
> Means STOP feeling BAD about who you are in the meantime and **stop comparing yourself to others:**
> 
UNCONDITIONAL ACCPETANCE is FAR BETTER cuz always someone better. 
YOU CAN’T ALLOW your ESTEEME to fluctuate so EASILY
>
**Your self-esteem should always be at its maximum, untouchable by other people and unshaken by events in the outside world.** 

Besides being the simple thing to do, there are more benefits to accepting yourself unconditionally. once you get a girl **without having relied on any extremely value** for your attractiveness, you also know for sure that she really likes you and that she will be yours for as long as you want her to be, as long as you do not change. You do not have to hide the fact that you lost your job, your car broke down, or that you are still living with your parents. Y.ar relationship will be less stressful and more honest, which is healthy.

> [!Example] The only problem is that children are conditioned to avoid "inappropriate" behavior, including acting more important than others without having earned that right, by feelings of shame.

# Don’t hide Sexual Interest
All forms of shame are indicators of your low self-esteem, which is why you have to get over them. However, it really becomes a problem when you are ashamed of your sexual desires, since you have to reveal to women that you find them sexy and that you want to have sex with them to seduce them. Otherwise, you will end up with a female friend, not a girlfriend, because sex is what separates the two kinds of relationships.
**Nevertheless, females are not less interested in sex than males are they are just more cautious and more concerned about appearing**
# Become Shameless
You should read this book in a public place, such as on the bus to school, on the subway to work, or at the cafe you go to on the weekends.
Not care about shirt wear or button open 
**become shameless so that you are able to do whatever you want to do, whatever needs to be done.** 

> [!Attention] if others let you know that you ought to be ashamed of anything, do not yield to their reality.
> what other people think of you and still consider their opinion
more highly than your own (you are submissive).

# Unyielding -To be stubborn, but with a smile
People will notice this when you are less reluctant to give in to their wishes and when you never sacrifice your convictions for the opinions or wishes of others.

SHOPS don’t allow yourself to be persuaded
Normal don’t allow self to be persuaded cuz pretty face is asking put your own self interest first

> [!Attention] you should never have to change your true self for women to get them. If you do, it is not really you that is getting girls, but some alternate persona.
>
> I allowed society and external people to control me & the reason why i hated culture here about wahmen was
> I HAVE MORE WORTH AND VALUE even than the PRETTIEST of girls
> Combo of Real-God-Lvl-Intelligence, Creativity, Self-Awareness that goes far far beyond common masses, STRONG SENSE OF WILL & DUTY (not lazy and complaining), one who have conquered and came over so so many negative forces that would have devoured anyone whole, 
> **SENSTIVITY & FEMININE ENERGY** along with **Godly Competitiveness & HARDWORKING NATURE**
> **COURAGE, the one who stands even if body too refuses to cooperate**
> Not even any person on discord
> **Someone who climbed out of hell alonoe with no support and still is GROWING STRONGER**

Why women loose interest cuz they are not unyielding - allow themselves to get bended how female wants them to be 
BECOMING AN HUSK.
and female being consfused now they are morphed to their liking why don’t they like him
Men confused he sacrificed all (friends, hobbies, etc) then why?

# Optimistic
BE SHAMELESS & FEARLESS 
Positive will handle uncertainity (Cuz SELF-RESPECT threaded so many mountains)
All men who are successful with women have such positive expectations instead of no-expectation or negative-expectation. 
(some assumes - she must have boyfriend, much better, more capable, "You wouldn't want to go on a date with me, would you?" )

# Self-Conscious
**People HAVE conditioned you by telling you “think about what other people will think of you” & seeing your face in MAN-MADE MIRROR**
As with all habits, the way to stop this bad behavior is to replace it  with something else, preferably something positive. Instead of thinking about what other people will think of you, 
**Self**-**Respect** start thinking about what you will think of yourself, your own opinion of yourself should be far more important than others' opinion of you, and no one besides you decides if it is.

<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 
# When you talk to WOMEN approach/talk as if they are ***HORNY AS HELL*** in ***MISCHEVIOUS/CURIOUS MODE*** wanting to ***KNOW MORE*** about ***your mystery and complexity*** 

<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 

---

# Don’t settle for ***JUST ANYONE*** show you have ***STANDARDS*** you ***Deserve ALL*** even ones people consider intimidating

Drop the notion of having to earn women.
**DOING STUFF LIKE**
“trying to become funnier, wine and dine, a woman, study for years to get a degree, buy a car or a house, work extra hours to afford a suit or watch of 
a classier brand, or learn magic tricks to be entertaining etc”
**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DESERVE THEM.**
***You still have to seduce them***, but that requires time spent directly with them, not long hours at the office or trying to ABC to prove yourself

**However, males who feel inadequate do several other things around women in an attempt to compensate for their inadequacy**

> [!Example] how a mother wants her son to treat her, as she is the primary female in her boy's life. 
She doesn’t want sexual relationship but seeks respect, *to seek her approval*, to be polite, **to apologize**, *to explain his behavior*, adapt to her commands, follow her lead, and do as he is told. 
This submissive behavior is the behavior a mother wants her son to exhibit when he interacts with her, but it is the opposite of the behavior that is sexually attractive to women who are naturally attracted to men, not boys.

# Approval Seeking
we behave dramatically differently when we need approval as opposed l, when we merely want it.
*It messes up your priming* - by eliciting specific childlike behavior the same way a young boy would seek his mother's approval
1. **At the first sign of disagreement or disapproval, they feel compelled to explain themselves.**
2. Hide their interests & pick up her hobbies
3. Feign interest
4. Fear speaking wrong
**YOU WILL NEVER EVER GIVE ANY MALE that much WHY FEMALE**
### you are inadequate by yourself or that you feel inferior and must prove yourself to someone more important than yourself
# Explain
Did with IOC SIR, On discord to Skyo accusation, etc
**The urge to let everyone else know** ***why*** they did ***what*** they did or what they **really meant** when they said what they said
==Manifestation of feelings of uncertainty and unimportance & wanting approval==
All such urges are about making sure a woman is okay- WHAT IF SHE DOESN’T **==APPROVE==**
**You are sabotaging yourself**
- afraid what might happen
- Not have very high-thoughts about yourself
**WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVE** - Don’t try to explain your ACTIONS/WORDS neither ==**before or after**==. DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
> [!Bug] GOOD RULE TO FOLLOW IS THAT
> 1) It is always better to ask for forgiveness afterwards than for permission
before.
> 2) No apologize than once a month

Being unapologetic does not mean offending people intentionally just to show them that you can. Don’t scream you don’t care cuz it will reveal you care actually, if you truly didn’t care then you wouldn’t bother to say it outloud  

# PAMPER
Males who are unsuccessful with women tend to tolerate a lot of
bad behavior if it’s beautiful female.
**HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO STANDARDS - don’t let them get away**
Although it is rarely necessary to scold a woman, a ==*woman can sense*== whether you would be ==*capable of scolding her or not*==.
#### STANDARS Impose NOT just PAMPER
==UPHOLD THEM ON THEIR DUTIES, you don’t need to be like - OH OH it’s okay I WILLN’T IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE I’m Sorry==
(with tongue or Bj both -  it’s responsibility though understand disgust - will allow give space to get comfortable - YOUR DUTY - I AM DOING & READY TO BEAR - yet you can’t even - I’m not so shallow to worry about pleasure it ain’t physicality or body related - EXPECT YOU TO BE STRONGER RESOLVE - not just do care/luv stuff when it’s comfortable)
















<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 
<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 

On a biological level women do care more about
1) Confidence measures ability to support a female 
2) will to care is found in his charm
both traits are reflected in how much responsibility he takes


Look into fact, why can you suddenly become more funny, confident, better at smooth talking IF YOU HAVE ULTERIOR MOTIVE 

Women who get their money from husband mock an beggar?

<center>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</center> 

Infinite CONVERSATION haxxx
Learn and read about TOPIC beforehand
- flat earth conspiracy and whole lore
- Do you feel advanced too far in techonology. WIll you delete any technology which one

Compliments Seeing Reading
 - wow! i really like it in people, growing up people around me i think held disinterested attitude towards reading and such so it’s **refreshing** and nice to find people 




















**Don’t treat her differently for being beautiful**
Not through anger but explaining the boundaries clearly 
==**It is often only necessary to be stern once, so the woman knows you mean business and really mean what you say.**== 
But do not scold women for no reason in an attempt to demonstrate that you regard yourself higher than you regard them-that will only cause more problems than it solves; 
**GOAL IS TO MAKE WOMEN FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT themselves without making them feel they are better than you are**

# Qualify 
> [!Attention] What they fail to realize is what happens whenever you try to qualify yourself.
*you communicate that you are inadequate by yourself or that you feel inferior and must prove yourself to someone more important than yourself.*
instantly communicated by a male bringing up 
- how long they have studied, 
- how much money they make,
- what car they drive, 
- what a nice area they live in, 
- what they have achieved, 
- how much alcohol they can drink, 
- what gadgets they have, etc. 
males think they are clever and believe they demonstrate how much of a catch they are when they boast and brag to women **shooting themselves in the foot**

# Impress
WORSE THAN QUALIFY
This does not mean that you cannot say impressive things to women. 
**It only means that information should come out unintentionally or as a natural part of the conversation when the topic comes up, rather than blurted out with odd timing.** 

if you just say it out of the blue, or if you ask her what she *thinks of or do or ABC* to mention your own ABC, she will sense that you are trying to impress her, **as if you are not good enough otherwise and are submissively looking up to her**.

# SACRIFICE
They are so submissive that they will do anything, not because
they love the woman so much, which is what they will tell the world,
but because they love themselves so little. They have no self-respect
> [!Attention] You must never put them on a pedestal if it would cause them to look down on you, as it usually tends to do. Although women love to be admired and appreciated, they still want **a man to look up to, not down upon,** a man who deems himself important enough to deserve the best, including the best women. He would be insulting them otherwise, not honoring them.
#### ==Charming man shows women that he appreciates them a lot, but never at his own expense. He knows his boundaries and stands his ground at necessary times.==

# Compensate
feels inadequate - **pay money to be together**
The expectation for males to pay for females, company is something that we all learn very early.
Pay for dinner. drinks, purchasing ring, wedding ceremony. 
(What’s equivalent of women doing of purchasing ring? **NOTHING** scam)

*FOR BOTH MAKEUP AND MONEY TO BE EFFECTIVE, THEY HAVE TO BE APPLIED PROPERLY; OTHERWISE, BOTH MALES AND FEMALES ARE MADE LESS ATTRACTIVE.*

**At the end of the day, though, the most attractive females do not need makeup, and the same goes for the most attractive males-they do not need money**

It should be spent without the expectation of anything in return-and that is not how most males use money with women. 
Men and boys **treat women like prostitutes** and won’t spend a single penny on women they know who won’t get into bed with them.
The fact is that **few females mind this.** difference b/w regular female and prostitutes is ***how indirect and vague the transaction must be for it to be acceptable*** but majority female won’t accept to being **prostitute** or atleast **part-time prostitute**
*A prostitute is any female who has sex in exchange for compensation, even if she likes the male or has turned down a thousand males before him. The only practical difference between a regular female and a prostitute is whether cash is being exchanged directly*
> [!Attention] EXCHANGING MONEY IS FELONY BUT 
> ***Accepting Gift- it’s LEGAL & socially acceptable***

Most males are raised with manners togive females flowers, chocolates, jewelry, or ice creams and dinner, all are compensation. The very idea that you have to compensate women in any way is wrong.
It would only be necessary if males were indeed less valuable than females, which they are not

> [!Summary] Society prospers if males believe they are of less worth because They will be willing to sacrifice themselves-to work, fight, and even die for the "greater good”

> [!Attention] Doesn’t mean oyu shouldn’t pay for her if you invite her to dinner BUT simply don’t make big deal out of it. ONLY PAY FOR SIMPLE & MUNDANE stuff not the grand ones cuz OTHERWISE it makes you look inadequate in yourself THAT YOU NEED MONEY
Use a different approach to meet women than offering them a drink, stop insisting on dates that cost money, 
and show that you care for your woman by the way that you treat her, how you look at her, what you say to her, how you hold her, etc., instead of by buying her things.

# COURAGEOUS
**YOU HAVE COURAGE WHICH IS OUT OF WORLD- for all you faced internally you still slithered forward**
most males attempt to increase their certainty.

More often than you think, the people you label as confident are not certain at all; they are merely able to tolerate uncertainty. 
lf you accept that women only care about your appearance, your life will be easier because appearance is something totally under your control, unlike feelings. you can act certain to appear as though you are sure of yourself by walking and talking as if you are, regardless of what you think of yourself. 
People around you will believe 
 - you know what you are doing, 
 - they cannot read your mind,
 - you will be perceived as more spontaneous
 - secure, 
 - relaxed, 
 - candid, 
 - direct, 
 - fearless, 
 - straightforward, 
 - unpredictable, 
 - adventurous, 
 - bold, 
 - brave, 
 - interesting. 
**Women often describe a man that they are attracted to in these terms without realizing that they are all byproducts of his confidence & COMFORT WITH UNCERTAINITY**
*Women love balls, but you do not have to risk your life to attract women*

**It does not matter that they may be deluding themselves or that what one man believes to be his key to success may actually contradict the belief of another man**
Some claim that their chiseled abs get them all the girls, some are convinced it is their downtown penthouse, some believe it is because they are handsome or funny, because they have a big penis, drive a  sports car, make money, dress well, dance well, have a dog, or are a doctor. 
The only thing they have in common is that they believe they know  what women want and they believe they have acquired it. That is the key; they possess so-called confidence,
and with this inner conviction they give themselves permission to take
action and start talking to women with the positive expectation of being attractive to them. 
This is why so many different approaches can work to some degree, including weird, lame, contradicting, and complex methods.
> [!Attention] Males link their confidence to so many different things. I may will tell you that their special trick matters because it does for  them, but it would not have to matter at all if they were not convinced that it did.

Answer is not to acquire that thing. 
The solution is to get your act together and challenge the bad social conditioning that affects you. your time alive is limited, so you must prioritize.
PRIORTIZING WRONG THINGS by focusing on 
- Muscles 
- Drinking
- Fixing Apartment 

Women will notice your low confidence, and all of a sudden it becomes a real problem. Do not make it a problem.
> [!Example] Understand that you already have what it takes to go after all the women you want. It is just a matter of taking proper action, and taking action should be your number one priority, not chasing things you do not need

Thinking in right direction is to consider if the matter you contemplate even existed long ago during "the age of cavemen”  - instantly rules out money and cars.

All of a sudden, you might think it is okay to take the bus to work, **that dancing is not that interesting anymore**, and drinking beer with your mates is not such an awesome way to spend your life.

> [!Attention] For instance, the typical "nice guys" who are so unsuccessful with women are convinced they know what women want, like exaggerated sensitivity and full-blown romance, but they still fail with women because the actions they take are ineffective

**a much better way to increase your confidence is to learn to tolerate uncertainty-to build courage. I his means being able to cope with situations even when you lack certainty, a much more useful trait that can help you in all of life's endeavors**

# INTIMIDATED
they cannot bring themselves to walk upto a woman and flirt with her in front of other people. 
They cannot even maintain eye contact without shying away when they find themselves alone with a lovely looking lady in an elevator

**women are not attracted to cowardly males because the more easily frightened a male is, the less confidence he has, the more vulnerable he appears, and thus the less attractive he is to females**

you were t' freak out in front of a female because of a deadly animal, you aright get some sympathy from a few females, but none of them can comprehend that women could frighten males the

# Tolerate Uncertainty EXPAND
> [!Error] Take action even if you are afraid to do it. Stop worrying about the outcome or what other people think of you. Take more chances and seize the moment.
Some people do not even dare to ask a stranger for directions if they are lost, while some might be able to relocate abroad to take a new job among people they have never met before

# Comfort ZONE
every time you attempt something you do not believe you can do, you feel varying degrees of discomfort and insecurity **(you feel uncertain)**
You must seek more face time with them despite your anxiety.

**Women dream of being swept off their feet by men, and you do that by approaching and interacting boldly with them.**
Normal men take easy road and try to avoiod discomfort and effort by using - introductions, personal-ads, online dating
**However, none of those popular approaches will ever be effective because women are attracted to males who are more likely to avoid such venues who have the balls to talk to women face to face**

> [!Quote] The more times you face your fears, ignore your wearies, and live through so-called embarrassing moments, the less power over you these learned emotions will have. They will gradually diminish. Eventually you will realize how ridiculous they are, and all those kinds of feelings will disappear altogether. until then, you have to have faith in yourself. Whatever happens, happens. You will handle it. You really cannot be certain of much in life anyway, so being able to tolerate un- certainty will improve your life on all levels. **This is the only way to permanently and truly become more attractive to women** as courage is nothing but unconditional confidence, and it is the most valuable thing you can offer a woman's genes

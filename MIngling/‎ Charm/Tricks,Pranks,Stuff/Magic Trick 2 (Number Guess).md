Master art of misdirection.

**I won't tell you answer. But i will give you hint.
Trick is more psychological, based on misdirection
*misdirection you already know way in which other person will act and respond and there are limited ways*
And exploiting jt
*How will you exploit it, I can't give on the pot simple example.*
But uh *like if you say bandar little high voice* i will look back, so using that knowledge of already knowing how I'll react to do something.



Hold, close eyes, imagine taste textures, draw in mind.

Different facial expressions l, eye positions, mouth relaxation.
Moment you opened paper number revealed 

Magic1-
When do 2-3 people at once. 
Tear strip of paper, write three names and three numbers and them each different number.
Fold it, ask them to sign/make marking to make sure I don't do anything with paper. 
**tell them I'm not telling what I have written it wil be revealed at end.
(Don't even let them know game is about number)**

otherwise trick will be exposed and tell them
*okay I will make you do different thing*
**doing **
(Must make them do before doing spewing non sense of choose the bigger one or blah blah
Is 
1) horizonal vertical line (they won't be choosing edges lines, especially corners )
2) choosing any x, cut down those x)
**illusion of their choice implant**
Draw one vertical and one horizontal line

**let's see who has bigger money line** (**joke**- my hand is bigger so I am richer automatically, 
okay **mam/sir** you are rich gaaribo ko maar do, baki amiro ko maar do
Paaise unse hi to aate hain)

- cancel everyone else
- keep the biggest square
- You are right handed? Keep the right handed smaller/bigger square
- you know left hand you can predict future
- **when it comes to elimination of only 3 being left (one number biggest, one middle, on small) for it play like tell them 
**True Universal genral - face bigger than hands can wrap and even if it isn't doesn't masger**
people with **hands bigger** than their face **gets** cancer** 
oh hands small **choose smallest number** 
Oh face bigger **choose biggest number.** 
(Rephrasing)
- for bigger & middle - 
****

**if their number lies on cross**
*first write numbers little diagonally on page so two spikes of cross faces them*
Then you can also make them do right hand left hand.

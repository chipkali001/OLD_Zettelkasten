Type Five is one of the [rarest enneagrams](https://enneagramgift.com/which-enneagram/#enneagram-type-5-rare), along with Eights and Fours. The rarity of this type causes many to overlook it, leading to a general lack of information about a Five. Below are some of the common characteristics of an Enneagram Type 5.

## What It’s Like to Be an Enneagram 5

Being an enneagram Five is fulfilling and enriching. Fives constantly work on improving their knowledge and always want to find new ways of becoming self-sufficient. To be a Five is to want to be reliant. [Their primary desire is to be competent, and their biggest fear is being helpless](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5). While they benefit from relationships with others that can foster emotion and sentiment in them, too many connections can be overwhelming to an Enneagram Type 5. They need a sense of space to satisfy their most basic need.

Enneagram Fives notice everything around them. Few things are unnoticed by the Five, as they will spend much time observing the world around them. **Another name for an Enneagram Type 5 is The Observer**, due to how much attention they place on details. The keen observations of an enneagram five are one thing that sets them a part of the other types. Characteristically, they recognize and notice things better than different personality types.

## Healthy Enneagram 5

A healthy Enneagram 5 is open-minded to the world around them and connected to a group of meaningful friendships. While still hungry for knowledge and understanding, they are careful not to allow this trait to overwhelmingly interfere with creating meaningful relationships or positively impact their work.

An [Enneagram 5 in growth](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-stress-and-growth/#:~:text=Enneagram%205%20In%20Growth) exhibits the healthy characteristics of an [enneagram type 8](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-type-8/). Their perceptive qualities allow them to offer objective, in-depth and insightful observations of situations and information as they carefully balance complex issues and data. They can communicate the necessary steps for integrating action to solve complex problems.

An Enneagram 5’s interests and intellectual ideals enable them to explore and build expertise in various fields, topics, and theories. Their diverse interests can often result in unconventional ideas and depth of knowledge, enabling them to be inventive, visionary, and pioneering.

A healthy Enneagram 5 will use their observational skills to serve and stay connected to others. They are more likely to willingly share their insights with others from servanthood rather than superiority.

## Unhealthy Enneagram 5

An unhealthy Enneagram 5 will become argumentative. An [enneagram 5 in stress](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-stress-and-growth/#:~:text=Enneagram%205%20In%20Stress) exhibits the shortcomings of an [enneagram type 7](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-type-7/). They can become obsessive toward radical ideas and thoughts, attempting to force their beliefs on those around them.

Lacking emotional intelligence, they will get into heated disputes where they are unwilling to listen to the opposing side. Their investigative nature will not give up on their increasingly extreme values and will become uninterested in the other person’s feelings while arguing.

Enneagram Type 5’s thrive on intellect. When they get to unhealthy levels, this only becomes enhanced. [They become](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-5-investigator) engulfed in their mind and struggle to connect with others. They start to lose a sense of reality and will cut off contact with their peers.

Enneagram fives at dangerously low levels often have no contact with others; while this is highly unhealthy, being alone with their thoughts gives them a sense of safety and security.

Unhealthy Enneagram 5’s often do not know how to manage the feelings of others. Struggling with emotions is a common trait for enneagram fives because they are a part of the [Head Triad](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-triads/).   Enneagram types in this triad depend on their thoughts to guide their decisions which can cause difficulty emotionally connecting with others. Their inability to communicate feelings can easily miscommunicate a lack of emotional intelligence to others.

If an enneagram five lives at unhealthy levels, their ability to demonstrate emotional connection is even less. Unhealthy enneagram 5’s are insensitive towards their peers and make little attempt to empathize with those around them.

When Enneagram Type 5’s become more reclusive, this is one of the easiest ways to tell that they are slipping into lower levels. The Five can fall into a pit of social recluse without realizing what is happening. Their introversion is harmful to their relationships, whether they seek to. 

An unhealthy Enneagram 5’s abrasive and cynical attitude can often lead their friends to end the connection with them, as they can no longer handle the Five’s **extreme and insensitive** ideas.

## [Enneagram Type 5 Relationships](https://enneagramgift.com/enneagram-compatibility-tips/)

Fives do not burden their partner with an overwhelming amount of emotion. [Fives are self-reliant](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/relationship-type-5-with-type-5) and do not demand much in their relationships. Typically, whether it be a romantic or platonic relationship, enneagram type 5’s remain level-headed and do not easily demonstrate how invested they are with the person.

Type Fives want to get to know the other person one-on-one. They ask questions until they feel as though they fully understand their partner. Fives will inquire until they feel as though their curiosity has been satisfied. At the beginning of the relationship, the partner may mistake this for the Five having enchantment with them, as it almost seems intensely romantic.

Fives wish to conquer everything they do not know, and their curiosity often shines through in relationships. While an enneagram five may care about the person, they may not ask intimate questions. The Five may just be bewildered by a differing enneagram and will continue to inquire until they finally understand them.

**Boundaries are essential for a Five**. Fives are usually introverted and have a desire for personal space. They can be overwhelmed if the relationship starts interfering with their ability to be on their own. Fives are self-reliant and enjoy relationships that provide space for independence.

To an enneagram five, unwelcomed service hinders their ability to maintain their desire to be independent. Fives who receive too much help without asking for it can become more hostile and stubborn. When this happens, an enneagram type 5 may lash out at their partner or, in some cases, emotionally retract. Those in a relationship with an enneagram five should attempt to be courteous of their desire to remain self-reliant, or the connection will not be long-lasting.

It is not uncommon for those in a relationship with a Five to feel as though they are impersonal. Speaking directly with a Five can be difficult, as they may feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed. They may start to act sarcastically or use humor to avoid the situation. **Relationships with a Five can quickly turn distant**, leading to the relationship ending. 

Fives find it challenging to talk about their feelings, so it is difficult to resolve issues once they begin. However, this does not mean they do not want to resolve the issue; their partner may need to exercise patience to connect their emotions with their thoughts. Doing so will permit the five to feel safe sharing their feelings and help create a deeper level of connectedness.

Mental energy is vital to a Five. Fives enjoy debating and exercising new concepts with close friends and those they love. The other person must match this energy and share the Five’s need for stimulating conversation.

However, enneagram type 5’s can use their hunger for data to create a level of collaboration with their coworkers. Gathering input and insight from those they work with can enhance their conclusions and benefit the team’s effort.

When collaboration is necessary, an Enneagram Type 5 wants to ensure they still have freedom and that their teammates will listen to them. If this is not possible, the Five can become increasingly frustrated.

A self-aware enneagram type 5 knows what they can do in congruence with their skillset. Enneagram fives believe they can complete an assignment or project independently but sometimes struggle to trust their coworker’s capability. Their independence can lead to misunderstanding as coworkers may find them challenging to work with or egotistical. An enneagram type 5 should try to overcommunicate, include others, and share praise for others.

Fives enjoy acquiring new knowledge. They do not do well in careers that cause them to remain stagnant, as they want to improve continually.

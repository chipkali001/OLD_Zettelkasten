this sentence "I feel like I have a handle on ethics. Just, my own morals are corrupt." doesn't make  that much sense to me?
i think values u have is what u have, it's permanent & unchanging 
u can learn and try to adopt new values 
but how can it be corrupted

steph101 â€” Today at 1:08 AM
By an abusive family.
By venturing out to see what certain lifestyles are like.
I wanted away from both bubbles: Christianity and abuse.
"You're not supposed to watch p__n in front of us!" ... as I ate my gas station burrito that could've had a bug in it. :p (12 yrs old)

JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:13 AM
well, i don't how to make sense of that

steph101 â€” Today at 1:14 AM
Me either. That's what I keep trying to understand.
Oh the bug
My sister found a bug in her burrito. I checked mine. No bug. Kept eating.

JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:15 AM
Is the question why will you act that way?
or is the people telling you stuff the problem?
or the values those people are guided by
?
JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:16 AM
why?

steph101 â€” Today at 1:16 AM
I had no chance at good values, coming from my family/nurture. They were pretty horrible
I still like burritos. I'm not wasting a burrito because someone found a bug in theirs.
JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:18 AM
Well huh, i will most likely do the same thing if noone's wataching
so it's difficult for me to say anything
but i think i won't go to same place next time 
steph101 â€” Today at 1:19 AM
I ate it because I wanted to, but my sister didn't want to and she got yelled at .."eat your fn burrito!"
JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:20 AM
even though there was a bug in it?
forcing someone like this is horrible
steph101 â€” Today at 1:21 AM
Yes. Because my dad is/was selfish and she (in his mind) was distracting him from watching porn.

Later that night, he told her that she's not worth a piece of toilet paper (to blow her nose with).
My sister is passive. I'm not.

JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:22 AM
Wait Wait
i thought you were the one watching porn?
No this is completly wrong
waht is this
why will he do that?
steph101 â€” Today at 1:23 AM
I sat in my bed, writing coded notes of the night, to tell my school counselor. 

I tried to help her, but she's always felt like she deserves abuse or just isn't strong enough to stand against it

She lives right next to my dad, has let him babysit her kids.
She's married, thankfully. Her husband protects her.

I'm divorced, can't raise my kids (because: cycle breaker), and very alone.

i can't imagine how much suffering you have & still are endeuring 
i hope you find some kind of contentment
steph101 â€” Today at 1:32 AM
I've been "UDUF" despair for most of my life. It's second nature, though I'm exhausted and fight bad thoughts of ending it - after I Body Temple leave my legacy/autobiography, so that my kids understand WHY everything occurred. 

I'm so used to fighting those thoughts, so I'll be fine.

JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:34 AM
i really cant find words to say
steph101 â€” Today at 1:35 AM
Is it that I want to be justified? I guess. 
I get mad at other people often, but easily forgive. 
Forgiving myself doesn't seem a thing. And I get that I don't get to decide who deserves what. I'm merely expressing what's in my head.
JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:37 AM
Maybe there is some kind of solace, and strength we get by imagining telling story of your suffering to someone else
steph101 â€” Today at 1:38 AM
I got to tell some of it last night and then, now.
It makes me cry, every single time, when someone at all cares to hear it.
JamunaKeBandarKaMattiKaJhopda â€” Today at 1:40 AM
i don't think i will be much help but i really wish you find some kind of mental peace
and don't have to suffer in future
i was only isolated and depressed for 2-3yrs in despair mode,& i feel that in that time - wanting someone to hear and understand me 
kept me in despair for long
so maybe
trying not to think of it
may help
but you are living it for so long
so i really don't know
steph101 â€” Today at 1:43 AM
I think the main reason I haven't liked the ENTPs is that I'm aware that they think suffering is almost GOOD.

I'm tired of suffering and need a break. 
I'm in my own way, now.

i think type of suffering that strips meaning and colours off your life isn't GOOD
in any way
steph101 â€” Today at 1:48 AM
Without my suffering, I'd be more of an idiot.
It helped.
But I'm too tired to do anything, afraid to suffer more.

I watched him (intp) talk to his daughter (istp). Then I questioned her type, when he said that money has been a big driver for her.
Then she said she likes solving problems.

steph101 â€” Today at 2:22 AM
My son's father tried to teach me how to make a webcam model site for myself, I guess similar to what Tate was trying to do for women. 

I was ALREADY in the industry, but I'm not great at knowing how to act on camera. 

In person, it was easier and faster.
